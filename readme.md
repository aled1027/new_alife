# alife
This repository contains the codebase of the current alife group. It is intended to be well-organized and well documented so that future members of the group can run, edit, and contribute new code. 

## history
It contains refactored versions of code written primarily by Drew Blount (data-processing pipeline, tf-idf, the ever-present 'parallelMap' and its variants), and also Andy Buchanan (e.g, the parser).
