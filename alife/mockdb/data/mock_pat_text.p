VFastener feed apparatus and method** A fastener feed assembly for a tool such as a power screwdriver having a drive member such as a rotatable bit includes a base fixed to the tool and a nose assembly slidably related to the base. The nose assembly includes a workpiece engaging surface, and when the tool is moved toward the workpiece during a fastener driving operation, the base moves toward the nose assembly. A return spring separates the base and nose assembly when the tool is withdrawn away from the workpiece. A strip of fasteners is fed from a magazine along a feed path through the nose assembly with sequential fasteners located in a drive position. Normally the drive member is spaced from a fastener in the drive position. During movement of the tool toward the workpiece in a driving operation, the drive member moves into engagement with a fastener in the drive position, and then continues to move in order to drive the fastener into the workpiece. A pawl is engageable with the strip in order to advance the strip along the feed path. During the driving operation, a feed mechanism operates in response to movement of the base toward the nose assembly to cock the pawl by moving it away from its home position along the strip away from the drive position. A lost motion arrangement delays cocking of the pawl until after secure engagement of the drive member with a fastener in the drive position. In response to withdrawal of the tool from the workpiece, the feed mechanism returns the pawl to its home position to feed an adjacent fastener of the strip to the drive position. Feed movement of the pawl is delayed until withdrawal of the drive member from the strip feed path. The strip includes a carrier with structure deformed during the drive operation for preventing reverse movement of the strip during cocking of the pawl.

VLean prechamber outflow combustor with two sets of primary air entrances** A combustion apparatus for gas turbine engines particularly adapted to reduce emissions to meet automotive requirements. The fuel is laid on the wall of a cylindrical prechamber and evaporated from the wall by combustion air which is introduced through a swirler at the upstream end of the prechamber. The inner surface of the prechamber is artificially roughened by a grid of grooves to improve fuel evaporation. The fuel is laid on the wall from an annular manifold extending around the upstream end of the prechamber through tangential orifices leading from the manifold into the interior of the prechamber. The fuel manifold is cooled and shielded from heat by an air jacket. More air enters through entrance ports distributed around the prechamber toward its downstream end. The resulting lean fuel-air mixture is delivered past an annular flow dam at the outlet of the prechamber into a combustion or reaction zone which is abruptly enlarged from the prechamber. The structure causes turbulent flow, recirculation, and good mixing in the reaction zone. A dilution zone downstream of the reaction zone has a circumferential array of dilution air ports which are of such shape as to be varied nonlinearly in area by a sliding ring valve. The sliding ring valve is coupled to a second sliding ring valve which varies the area of the air entrance ports in the prechamber in reverse sense to the dilution air ports. A pilot fuel nozzle to aid in cold starts is mounted at the upstream end of the prechamber.

VConstant oil level control for transmission sump** A power shift transmission having a fluid pressure control system having an intake screen and level control located centrally in the bottom of the sump and a pump and regulator valve supplying pressure to the shift control system and to a sump oil level control. The sump oil level control has a small float controlling a relay valve to control an oil level control valve connecting an elevated oil reservoir for gravity feed to fill the sump and pressure return to the reservoir to dump the sump. When the transmission input and pump is not driven, there is no pressure in the chambers at opposite ends of the differential land area level valve and balanced springs hold the level valve in a central closed position blocking flow to and from the reservoir, to the sump and from the pressure line so the oil level control is inoperative. When the transmission input is driven, a small flow of line pressure is supplied through an inlet restriction to each chamber. When the oil level is low, a miniature float provides a small force to close the miniature relay valve closing a restricted exhaust from the chamber at the larger area land so equal pressures in the chambers act on the differential land area to move the level valve to the fill position closing the supply pressure port and providing a full flow connection from the reservoir for gravity feed at a low volume rate of flow to the sump. When the oil level is high the float permits the pressure to open the relay valve and the restricted exhaust reduces the pressure in the larger area chamber to move the level valve to dump position closing the sump port and connecting a restricted supply pressure branch to the reservoir so the transmission pump delivers fluid at the same low volume rate of flow from the sump to the reservoir to reduce the oil level. In a modification a level indicating thermistor controls a solenoid controlled relay valve similarly controlling the oil level valve.

VDigital music synthesizer** The system of this invention is for use with an electronic musical instrument having a keyboard, and generally includes keyboard circuitry, audio waveform generators, envelope generators, static and dynamic filter circuitry and power amplifier and speaker apparatus. In accordance with one feature of this invention, the system comprises means for establishing different digital voice codes which are coupled to read only memories associated with the audio waveform generators, envelope generators and main voice circuitry. This voice code provides a limited number of program conditions to control such variables as audio waveform pulse widths, envelope attack, decay, sustain or release intervals, and instrument resonator control. Another feature of the present invention is concerned with the keyboard circuitry which operates from a digital key and octave code. Each code is sequentially interrrogated to determine if the corresponding key has been played. Although the completely illustrated embodiment is of a monophonic system, this sequential interrogation scheme lends itself quite readily to polyphonic operation. Still another feature of the invention resides in a novel digital controlled oscillator of the audio waveform generators that includes a feedback control loop and wherein the majority of the components of the oscillator only operate over a one octave range.

VHydraulic controller** The hydraulic controller is for controlling the operation of a plurality of hydraulically controlled devices. Hydraulic fluid may be selectively distributed by the controller to various controlled hydraulic devices in a timed and predetermined sequence. The timing of the distribution of hydraulic fluid by the controller can be quickly and easily varied by various control knobs on the controller to thereby vary the timed operated period of the various machine operations controlled by such devices without affecting the timed operation of other machine operations. The controller is supplied with a source of hydraulic fluid under a generally constant pressure. Cam means are associated with each of a plurality of fluid flow distributing valves for operating such associated valve members in a predetermined sequence of valve positions upon advancement of the cam means relative thereto. Drive means including a pair of opposed indexing and timing device pistons; advance the cam means relative to the valves to operate them in sequence of positions and in operating intervals or dwell periods thereof. The indexing piston has an effective working diameter in its cylinder which is greater than that of the timing piston such that it normally overrides the timing piston. The cam drive means includes lost motion means for allowing the cam means and associated distributing valves to dwell during timing strokes. Fluid flow restrictor means adjustably restrict the flow of fluid through the venting means to control the speed of the timing stroke and thereby provide an adjustable timed interval of operation of the device then being operated.

VInternal combustion engine system** An internal combustion engine system, particularly as used for automotive vehicle propulsion, includes the engine with a muffler for reducing engine exhaust noise and fuelled by gas produced by a miniaturized gas reformer requiring heating and a supply of vaporized liquid hydrocarbon and oxygen-containing gas, the reformer usually being enclosed by a larger enclosure to form a space through which the engine exhaust is passed for supplying heat to the reformer, and having an exhaust heated heat-exchanger for its intake. By positioning the reformer inside of the engine's muffler so that the exhaust heat there is used to supply heat to the reformer, the need for the bulk-increasing larger enclosure is eliminated, and by arranging the intake heat-exchanger in the muffler so that the exhaust flow through the muffler is deflected both when entering and leaving the exchanger, a multi-deflected and therefore exhaust noise attenuation exhaust flow results.

VFireplace heater** A heat exchange device installed in a fireplace without any modification thereto completely encircling the fire, sides, top, back and bottom but without having the heating tubes and ducts exposed to the destructive concentrated heat that occurs at the fire bed level of grate or andiron and including twin cold air ducts extending from front to rear of the fireplace at one lower corner thereof, twin hot air ducts extending from front to rear of the fireplace at the other lower corner thereof with the twin ducts interconnected by a plurality of heat exchange tubes which extend upwardly along the side walls of the fireplace and then horizontally in overlying relation to the fire in the fireplace an additional tubes extending horizontally across the bottom of the fireplace. A motor driven fan is provided in the bottom cold air duct to circulate air through the device. The twin ducts, having interconnecting apertures to the rear, include baffle arrangements to guide the flow of air through the heat exchange tubes for most efficient utilization of the heat from the fire in the fireplace. A forced draft device is incorporated into the cold air duct for selective discharge of air at the base of the fire in the fireplace to facilitate the initial burning of the fuel and to provide a forced draft for proper combustion of the fuel whenever desired. When the fire is first lit, the resulting flames hitting and passing in between and around the overhead heating tubes encircling the fire provide heat almost instantly and as the fire progressively burns, the entire length of the heating tubes, both overhead and encircling the fire on both sides and to the back, become heated providing a continuous expanded volume of hot air which is forced out into the room, away from the fireplace, this air is then circulated and again re-enters the cold air tubes by being forcibly drawn from the floor level and ejected as heated air on the opposite side of the fireplace. This results in an even room temperature, even at floor level. As the fire progressively burns, coals and ashes falling through the apertures in the conventional grate cover the heating tubes extending across the floor of the firepplace thereby extracting heat from this area of the fireplace which becomes heated last, but which also retains heat the longest, long after the fire itself has burned out.

Radial movement of the blades may be adjusted by a pin having a conical tip adapted to bear against the radially innermost portions of the blade appendages. The pin is adjustable along the longitudinal axis of the reamer body by means of screw threads and a guiding slot, thereby limiting radially inward movement of the appendages and the blades while permitting the blades to swivel about each of the three pins.

Extending from the opposite end of the starting member along one of its curved sides is a row of rack teeth. Spaced laterally from the mold and at about the same level is a storage housing that has a substantially vertical passage through it for the starting member, while a pair of reversible pinch rolls located about halfway between the mold and storage housing but at a lower level are in a position to grip the lower end portion of the starting member while its upper end is plugging the mold. The rolls withdraw the starting member and a metal strand attached to it from the mold and feed the starting member up into the storage housing passage where a vertical gear engages the rack teeth. An overrunning clutch operatively connected with the gear permits the gear to free wheel while the starting member is being pushed up through the housing by the pinch rolls until the lower end of the strand is past those rolls. The lower end of the strand then is bent down to separate it from the starting member and to straighten it while the starting member is supported by the gear, which is prevented by the clutch from turning in the reverse direction. After the strand has left the pinch rolls, the clutch is driven at a controlled speed in the direction that will allow the lower end of the stored starting member to return by gravity to those rolls so that it can be fed by them back to the mold.

At the end of each run there is a return bend that conveys the fluid on the inner tube around to the next tube in the tube exchanger and also conveys the outer tube fluid to the next tube system. The inner tube system is carrying sludges that are obtained in a sewage treatment plant or an industrial waste treatment plant or any other type of treatment plant where sludges are produced and it is desired to heat treat these in order to release the bound waters and thereby effect a dewatering of the sludge cake which is not possible without sludge heat treat systems. The outer tube conveys a liquid which is usually water which has been treated. The outer tube conveys a liquid which is usually treated water which gives up the heat from an outside source to the sludge on the inner tube in a consistent manner. The inner tube takes the heat from the sludge and transfers it to the water to preheat the water. The return bend is designed so that the sludge on the inner tube is conveyed through the outside portion of the return bend and the water from the outer tube is channeled through a channel on the inner side of the return bend. Built into the return bend is a heating surface where there can continue to be a transfer of heat between the water and sludge within the return bend.

Each receiver includes means for supporting a liquid container in an inverted, vertically disposed position with successive ones of the containers having their liquid outlets positioned at a different vertical level than the liquid outlet levels of the other containers. This arrangement permits the establishment of an initial steady state liquid level wherein all the container liquid outlets are at least covered by liquid to prevent further liquid flow therefrom. When a selected portion of liquid is removed from the manifold for dispensing or other use, the initial steady state liquid level is temporarily lowered so as to uncover the highest vertically disposed container liquid outlet. This uncovering permits air to flow into the container to facilitate liquid flow therefrom until the initial steady state liquid level is again reestablished to block further liquid flow. At all times during liquid dispensing from the manifold itself, replacement liquid is only drawn from the container having its liquid opening at the highest vertical level and which also has liquid therein. The arrangement further includes a normally closed flow valve associated with each container. A container support and sealing means is provided for each receiver to assure proper location and retention of the containers relative thereto.

VAirplane wing camber control** The angular configuration of a fluid control surface, with respect to the relative direction of fluid flow, is controlled by selectively heating the structural portions of only one side of the control surface to expand the structural members on the one side with respect to the structural members on the other side for warping the control surface generally from its leading to its trailing edge. Particularly, the camber of an airplane wing is changed by this selective heating for controlling the wing portion lift. Preferably, wires extend generally from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the wing as wing structural members closely adjacent the upper and lower surfaces of the wing, with both sets of wires being prestressed to provide an intermediate camber for the wing portion when the upper and lower wires are the same temperature, a generally symmetrical wing configuration when only the lower wires are heated, and a high lift maximum camber when only the upper wires are heated. The wires may be electrically heated by the passage of current therethrough, closely adjacent the wing surface for air cooling, deeply embedded in the wing structure for insulation, or contained within concentric tubes conducting a cooling or heating fluid. Further, the wires may be organic synthetic fibers with electrically conductive material embedded in them for thermal expansion, or a composite of electrically conductive and non-electrically conductive fibers for thermal expansion, or composed of an electrostrictive material to shorten upon the passage of electrical current, or of composite structure as above mentioned, with an electrostrictive component for shortening with the passage of a current.

Part of the gas for inflating the bag is stored in a high pressure gas reservoir. Another portion is generated by combustion of a pyrotechnic mixture. In a preferred embodiment the gas storage cylinder and pyrotechnic generator are coaxial with an axial gas flow passage through the pyrotechnic generator for collecting and conveying gas. A frangible diaphragm separates the pyrotechnic gas generator from the high pressure gas storage vessel. The gas generator has four compartments surrounding the gas flow passage, each containing a pyrotechnic gas generator grain. Combustion gas flows from one of these compartments through another and thence to the axial gas passage. In each embodiment the two inflation gas sources are in series with the inflatable bag rather than in parallel with each other.

VInflatable garment for crash protection** An inflatable garment or suit of clothing worn by a motorcycle rider is detachably connected with a source of pressurized gas operative to inflate the suit in response to a predetermined deceleration of the motorcycle, or manual operation of a trigger adjacent the motorcycle hand grip when a crash or spill appears to be inevitable. If the rider jumps or is thrown from the motorcycle, the suit will pull loose from the gas source by virtue of the detachable connection and will remain inflated for an appreciable time interval to protect the rider from multiple impacts. The detachable connection is also manually operative to permit the rider to disengage the suit in its non-inflated condition from the gas source without triggering the latter, and thereby to leave the motorcycle while still wearing the suit.

A speed error signal whose magnitude is proportional to the error in the frequency of the pulsating fluidic signal, is generated from a control output port of the fluidic governor for regulating the energy supply to the prime mover by means of the valve to correct the speed of the drive shaft output of the prime mover.

VOil well pumpoff control system utilizing integration timer** A valve in the production flow line of an oil well closes a reed switch indicative of fluid being pumped through the line. The switch closure activates a first oscillator whose count is compared with a variable frequency oscillator having a frequency of approximately one-half that of the first oscillator. The comparison is made over a given period of time to ascertain the percentage of time the valve has been open and passing fluid. Theoretically, the valve should be open approximately fifty percent of the time because almost that much time is taken on the downstroke of the pumping assembly when no production is occurring. The integrated timer is adjusted to shut down the system when the percentage of time the valve is open drops to the preselected amount, usually equal to or less than around 50 percent. In response to the integration timer producing a signal, a shutdown timer is turned on which restarts the cycle after a preselected amount of time. The length of shutdown time for the pumping unit is preset according to the well fill-in rate. When the system is restarted by the shutdown timer, a pump-up timer is turned on which is adjusted to allow for a desired pump-up time. As the pump-up timer is allowing the system to recycle, the integration timer is reset and the recycling is completed if the requirements of the integration timer are met. Otherwise, the unit is shut down again and the system recycled. A variable electronic scaler is connected to the output of the integration timer which monitors the output signals from this timer.

The inner tubing passes through the wall of the outer tubing near the upper end thereof and is connected to a pressurized cylinder of gas such as a standard 14 oz. propane gas cylinder. When the lower ends of the tubes are well submerged beneath the water level in a well, admission of gas to the inner tube at its upper end will force water up through an annular space between the tubes and out the upper end of the outer tube where it can be collected. A channeled plug at the bottom of the tubes prevents the tubes from collapsing, helps to keep them straight and together as they are lowered into the well and provides partial support for a weight hanging from the bottom of the tubes.

VAir tool overspeed shutoff device** An overspeed shutoff device for use in a rotary pneumatic tool is disclosed. The device is operable to shut off air supply to the motor on failure of its governor to function properly in preventing overspeeding of the motor. The device includes a valve closing plate positioned in the path of air flow to the pneumatic motor, just upstream of an inlet port for passage of air into the motor. In normal operation of the tool the valve plate, which rotates with the motor drive shaft, is retained in a position spaced from the air inlet port by a locking mechanism engaging the drive shaft of the tool to prevent axial movement therealong. The plate locking device comprises a cantilever mounted spring wire in engagement with a groove in the drive shaft and a centrifugally responsive weight operably connected to disengage the wire from the groove in response to the attainment of a predetermined rotary speed. Upon failure of the main governor of the tool and consequent acceleration of the motor to such predetermined speed, the wire is disengaged from the shaft groove and the air pressure drop across the valve inlet port causes the closure plate to move toward and cover the inlet port, thereby stopping the flow of air to the motor.

VExtruder controller** Thickness of a sheet being produced by an extruder is controlled in response to measurements of: sheet thickness, the speed at which material is fed through a screw of the extruder, as determined by screw speed, and the speed with which material is taken away from the extruder, as determined by sheet speed. Measured thickness is compared with a setpoint for sheet thickness and a determination is made as to whether the thickness is in a predetermined, deadband region relative to the setpoint, or if the sheet is out of the deadband because it is excessively thin or excessively thick. In response to the sheet thickness being in the deadband region, the screw speed is changed in response to a signal indicative of the product of sheet speed error and rate of change of screw speed with respect to sheet speed. Sheet speed is controlled by multiplying sheet speed error by a predetermined constant. In response to the sheet being excessively thin, screw speed, if it has not reached a maximum value, is changed by multiplying sheet thickness error by rate of change of screw speed with respect to sheet thickness; if the screw speed has reached a maximum value, sheet speed is changed by multiplying the thickness error by the rate of change of sheet speed with respect to thickness. In response to the sheet being excessively thick outside of the deadband region and the sheet speed has not reached a predetermined maximum, line speed is changed by multiplying sheet thickness error by the rate of change of sheet speed with respect to sheet thickness; if the line speed has reached the predetermined maximum, screw speed is changed in response to an indication of the product of sheet thickness error and rate of change of screw speed with respect to sheet thickness. The various rates of change are calculated from an equation which models sheet thickness, T, screw speed, V.sub.S, and sheet speed, V.sub.L, in accordance with: ##EQU1## where: A, B AND C ARE PREDETERMINED CONSTANTS DETERMINED FOR EACH EXTRUDER MACHINE AND ASSOCIATED APPARATUS.

VMethod for increasing metallic yield in bottom blown processes** In the Q-BOP process for the production of low carbon steels (eg. 0.02 - 0.05% C), inert gas-oxygen mixtures are employed during the latter part of the blow, i.e. when the C content of the melt reaches a level of about 0.25%. As such lower carbon contents, the rate of decarburization is not decreased by dilution of the oxygen with inert gas. However, such dilution results in less O.sub.2 being available for oxidation of iron, hence significant increases in metallic yield may be achieved. By precise control of the O.sub.2 /inert gas ratio, increases in metallic yield in excess of 2% are achieved.

A rechargeable battery (e.g.: Ni Cad) has a band of its insulated cover removed at a corresponding position so that the negative charging contact can touch the underlying portion of the battery container, and through that connection the charging circuit can be closed. The charging circuit cannot be closed if the battery is inserted with its polarity reversed. When a non-rechargeable battery is installed the recharging-circuit contact mates with a part of the insulation cover of the battery and the charging circuit cannot be closed. In one disclosed embodiment of the invention, if either battery is installed with its polarity reversed, the energizing circuit from the battery to the radio apparatus will not close.

VTHINNING SEMICONDUCTIVE SUBSTRATES** In making a target for a television camera tube, it is necessary to thin the backside of a semiconductive substrate, which is opposite a face having a diode array thereon. To thin the substrate, it is positioned face down on a fluid nondeleterious to the substrate and diode array. The fluid is contained in a cavity of a holding device. The positioning is such that there is no space between the fluid and the substrate. An apertured top member is then mounted on the substrate and the holding device to retain the substrate on the fluid. The assembly of the holding device and top member with the substrate therebetween is immersed and rotated in an etchant to thin the backside of the substrate through the aperture of the top member. The fluid provides a tight seal on the face of the substrate to prevent the etchant from damaging such face and the diode array thereon. A vent extending from the cavity of the holding device to its outer edge assists in the subsequent removal of the substrate from the cavity.

During the speed increase, a number of other machine variables are compared with set limit values and the speed increase is discontinued when a limit is exceeded for a predetermined time period. When the steam pressure has been at a limit, or the steam valve has been wide open, for a predetermined time period the control system, upon sensing the limit being reached, switches to a dryer limited mode of operation wherein the steam pressure is maintained at the limit or the steam valve is locked open. The sheet moisture content is then controlled by a combination of automatic stock valve and machine speed adjustments, while basis weight is controlled by coordinated machine speed adjustments. The control system is adapted for universal use with many machine arrangements which may have separated and/or split dryer sections for rewet or coating operations and the like and/or curl control. To this end, the controller includes a system of logic which determines the optimum control procedure in each case.

VApparatus and method for biological analysis** A continuous method and apparatus for the determination of urea in a biological fluid such as blood, for example, is disclosed. In a continuously flowing system, the biological sample is introduced into a buffered carrier solution of low electrical conductance and is caused to flow into a chamber containing an immobilized enzyme which catalyzes a specific reaction which changes the electrical properties of the solution by increasing the dissociated ion concentration therein. This increase in dissociated ion concentration is directly proportional to the original concentration of urea in the biological sample; and any one of the several conventional electrical measurements may be made to determine the increase in such concentration or the rate of increase in such concentration and thereby determine the concentration of urea in the original biological sample. The buffered carrier solution containing the products of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is reclaimed by circulating it through a deionization, purification stage in which the solution conductivity is substantially returned to the prereaction value. The carrier solution is recirculated and used for processing additional samples. The enzyme, urease, is immobilized in a manner which allows many tests to be run without any significant loss thereof. The savings in enzyme requirements and the savings accomplished by recirculating the buffered carrier solution greatly reduces the cost of analysis.
