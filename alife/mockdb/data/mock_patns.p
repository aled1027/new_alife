p384
sVabstract
p385
VAn improved method for detecting a laundry weight in a washing machine employing a sensorless BLDC motor is provided. The motor is rotated until the washer reaches a first speed. The washer then operates in a torque control mode for a predetermined amount of time, and a laundry weight is then determined based on a speed of the motor after the predetermined amount of time has elapsed. In this manner, laundry weight can be accurately determined and the laundry can be effectively washed. Additionally, since a washing machine employing this improved method for detecting does not require a hall sensor and its peripheral circuit manufacture is simplified, and thus cost may be reduced.

It may also be provided in various shapes and sizes or materials to also suit the users preference. The toilet bowl brush cleaning system is designed to allow the user to put the toilet brush in the cleaning system, into a cleaning agent located in the second level, to be cleaned and disinfected and then pulled back up through a ringer that will ring out the remaining liquid. Then the toilet brush will be stored in the first level thus allowing any cleaner that may remain on the brush to drain off into the second level. The toilet bowl brush is now ready for its next use. This cleaning system will allow the toilet bowl brush to be cleaned and disinfected between uses, so the user no longer has to clean his or her toilet brush in the sink or bathtub, or have the toilet waste that drains off of the toilet bowl brush, gathering at the bottom of the toilet brush holder after each use. The user of the cleaning system will fill the second level of the cleaning system with a cleaner of their choice for the cleaning of the toilet bowl brush. This system will have a disposable third level or compartment for the used cleaner at the bottom of the cleaning system. The used cleaner can be passed from the second level to the third level by pulling up on the stopper which will allow the used cleaner to drain from the second level to the third level or compartment. This third level can be removed and replaced with a new compartment or cleaned and replaced The third level compartment will be big enough thus allowing the user to empty the used cleaner into this compartment or level more than once before having to be replaced with a new, level or compartment.

sVabstract
p700
VA peg has a one-piece clip essentially consisting of two branches, each branch having an anterior part forming a jaw and a posterior part forming a lever arm. The peg also has a hinge around a rotational axis that connects the branches at an intermediate point. A spring extending along a direction substantially perpendicular to the rotational axis is mounted and compressed between the two lever-forming parts of the two branches. The spring urges, under its biasing resilience, the two branches to a closed position. The spring has a biasing force in the direction of increasing its axial longitudinal dimension that is more controllable over time than a spring having a biasing torque. Thus, over time the pressure exerted by the arms of the peg in the closed position remains more constant.

VProcess for manufacturing a magnetic read head
p969
sVabstract
p970
VIn magnetic read heads based on bottom spin valves the preferred structure is for the longitudinal bias layer to be in direct contact with the free layer. Such a structure is very difficult to manufacture. The present invention overcomes this problem by using a liftoff technique to form, on the free layer, a buffer layer having a trapezoidal cross-section, sloping sidewalls, and a central area of uniform thickness, whose width defines the read track. A suitable bias layer and leads are then deposited on this buffer layer.

VMethod of manufacturing metallic wire segment
p1044
sVabstract
p1045
VOne end of a metallic wire having a rectangular cross-section is widened by upsetting the end of the wire in its axial direction. At the same time, a swollen portion is formed at a position where the widened end portion is to be bent from a straight portion of the wire. Then, the widened end portion is bent at the bending position having the swollen portion. Thus, a metallic wire segment having the widened end portion bent at the bending position is manufactured without wasting any part of wire material, while avoiding formation of cracks on the outer surface of the bending position. Plural wire segments thus manufactured are combined to form a rotor winding of a rotational electric machine, forming a commutator surface by the widened end portions at the same time.

To accurately correlate the wavelength of a wavelength selector to the wavelength emitted by an optical transmission source, the present invention uses an optical detector and feedback loop to optimize the wavelength of an optical selection element in accordance with a wavelength of an incident optical channel. In one embodiment, the optical selection element is a Bragg grating associated with a grating wavelength controller, such as a temperature regulator or strain tuning system, to adjust the wavelength band of maximum reflectivity of the grating. The feedback loop communicates with the optical detector and the wavelength controller to modify the grating's reflection wavelength band in accordance with the wavelength of an incident optical channel.

VBy press-fitting a cylindrical blank into a die with one of a pair of punches, and at the same time press-fitting small diameter end portions and tapered portions of the pair of punches into both ends of the cylindrical blank while restraining both end surfaces of the blank with cylindrical members movable on the outsides of the punches, the external circumferential surface of the blank is finish molded to the required diameter by the internal circumferential surface of the die and, at the same time, tapered surfaces are formed on the inner circumferential surface in both ends of the blank. The process produces a bushing with its internal surfaces accurately coaxial, and with the external surface accurately formed to the required diameter.

p1341
sVabstract

VAn improved method, system, and device for a compass combining an electronic magnetic compass and an angular velocity sensing gyroscope. One aspect of the invention integrates an angular velocity output signal from an angular velocity sensor or rate gyroscope to determine the angle of motion. An initial magnetic heading is obtained from a geomagnetic sensor and used as a reference for the integrated angular velocity signal. A geomagnetic heading signal is blended with the angular velocity output signal at an adaptive time interval. The adaptive time interval is increased if the reliability of the magnetic field improves and decreased if the reliability of the magnetic field degenerates. Additionally, dynamic calibration of the angular velocity sensor may be performed to correct for gyroscope bias (zero offset), and/or gyroscope scale factor or gain.

VA backhoe () has a hydraulic cylinder () with a piston () that rotates a rotatable boom (). A lockable slider block () slides on the piston. Movement of the lockable slider block in one direction is caused by a spring () mounted around the piston, and in another direction is caused by the telescoping of the piston into the hydraulic cylinder. The backhoe includes a hydraulic valve () that controls hydraulic pressure to the hydraulic cylinder and a sensor () coupled to the hydraulic valve. Once locked to a position on the piston, the lockable slider block engages the sensor on each occasion the rotatable boom rotates beyond a preselected angle of rotation. Engagement of the sensor causes actuation of the hydraulic valve, thereby preventing further rotation of the boom by the hydraulic cylinder. Alternative embodiments have an encoder () that digitizes the position of the boom, and a microcomputer () that is programmed to actuate the hydraulic valve.

VTemperature coordinated through-line food packaging system
p1911
sVabstract
p1912
VA food packaging system wherein one or more food component preparation lines deliver heated, e.g., cooked, components to a packaging station that operates at overpressure to maintain aseptic conditions as a container is filled and sealed. The preparation line may be a high pressure heated conduit, a covered batch conveyer, sealed pocket feeder or similar line, and prepares each component at a temperature and time suitable for the particular ingredient. Plural separate preparation lines may deliver different food components to the pressure chamber in which filling occurs, and each component attains a narrowly-defined degree of cooking or uniform stage of undercooking. A loading lock interfaces the packaging and preparation sections so as to prevent evaporative fluid loss or cooling and preserve aseptic conditions during filling and sealing. The sealed containers may be heated or held in a sterilizing chamber for a brief time, after which they may be cooled, labeled and placed on or in pallets or cartons for shipping or storage. The food preparation lines (if more than one) may be configured to specifically perform cooking a different food component in each line before packaging. When a segmented flow preparation line is used, the segmenting elements may operate as pressure seals to deliver successive batches into the packaging station. For other lines, an entry chamber may include one or more load locks to transfer cooked food components into the station for packaging, and dosing pumps or robotic handlers may apportion, assemble or package the various components. The system extends the range of heat-sensitive food components, and of heat-sensitive packaging materials that may be used, providing a higher quality product.

VMethod and apparatus for controlling zipper tension in packaging equipment
p1926
sVabstract
p1927
VMethods and apparatus for controlling the tension of one continuous material (e.g., plastic zipper) with attachments or formed features (e.g., sliders or formed slider end stops) as it is fed to a sealing station, where it is joined to and later pulled by another continuous material (e.g., packaging film). The tension control scheme can be applied in cases wherein the packaging film advances a single package length per advancement as well as cases wherein the packaging film advances a distance equal to multiple package lengths per advancement. A tension control zone is created between a pair of nip rollers disposed in zipper processing equipment and a zipper sealing station inside a thermoforming packaging machine by applying a predetermined torque to one of the nip rollers using a torque control device. The zipper processing equipment may comprise a zipper shaping station and a slider insertion station. The torque control device applies a substantially constant torque that maintains the zipper tension substantially constant in the tension control zone, especially during zipper stomping, slider insertion and zipper sealing.

VRegeneration of diesel particulate filter for diesel engine
p2136
sVabstract
p2137
VAn oxidation promoting catalyst () which converts nitrogen monoxide in exhaust gas to nitrogen dioxide, and a diesel particulate filter () which traps soot in the exhaust gas, are installed in an exhaust gas passage of a diesel engine (). A control unit () determines whether or not it is necessary to regenerate the filter based on the exhaust gas pressure detected by an exhaust gas pressure sensor (), and when it is necessary to regenerate the filter, it increases the nitrogen monoxide in the exhaust gas by performing an advance correction of the fuel injection timing of a fuel injector () so as to promote generation of nitrogen dioxide by the oxidation promoting catalyst. The nitrogen dioxide decreases the combustion temperature of the soot trapped by the diesel particulate filter (), and efficiently regenerates the filter.

In one illustrative embodiment, the temperature set point for the inside space is moved downward when the humidity of the inside space rises above a predetermined humidity set point threshold value. In warm climates, this causes the air conditioner of the HVAC system to be activated, which lowers the temperature of the inside space to a new lower temperature set point. In some embodiments, the HVAC system retains the new lower temperature set point for a predetermined time period. The predetermined time period may be dependent on a number of factors, including whether the space is expected to occupied or unoccupied.

p2436
sVabstract
p2437
VA method of controlling process variables, for a fiberizing assembly including a rotary fiberizing disk in the manufacture of fibers from a high temperature, molten, clear or translucent, thermoplastic, fiberizable material, utilizes an optical sensor assembly. The optical sensor assembly includes a water-cooled optical fiber sensor probe which, in effect, only gathers light emitted from the external sidewall surface of the rotary fiberizing disk. The light is conducted from the probe to an electronic unit that converts the light energy into a temperature value. This temperature value is used to monitor the process and to make any changes in process variables, such as but not limited to heat input to the fiberizing disk, rate of rotation of the fiberizing disk, burner air/fuel ratio, required to produce fibers having desired fiber properties.

VA knitted surface fastener wherein pile loops are formed by knitting-in pile knitting yarns at the same time when a foundation fabric is knitted with foundation yarns. After the pile knitting yarns which form the pile loops stride between two or more wales to form loops, they are entangled with each stitch of the foundation yarns of three or more adjoining courses on a same wales continuously to form stitches. Of the stitches of the pile knitting yarns formed due to the pile knitting yarns entangled per each of the adjoining three or more courses, at least one or more stitches located in the middle are formed in a closed loop. Consequently, the necessity of back coating is eliminated and further, clearly square gaps are formed to achieve ventilation property and transparency.

p2707
VA mechanism for hemming the beltline of a vehicle door panel is combined with a mechanism for hemming the outside perimeter of the door panel, and the two mechanisms are driven by a common drive. The beltline hemming steel acts on the beltline hem before the outside perimeter hemming steel acts on the outside perimeter hem, and lost motion in the actuation of the beltline hemming steel allows the beltline hemming steel to complete the beltline hem before the outside perimeter hem is completed. The lost motion mechanism provides reduced interaction or sensitivity between the steels, and the delay in the completion of the outside perimeter hem allows the entire hemming apparatus to be more easily tuned during set-up. The lost motion allows the entire mechanism to be less sensitive to variations in workpiece thickness.

VA bubble detector utilizes an ultrasonic transducer to sample bubbles as they pass the transducer. The envelope of the return signal is analyzed to determine the volume of each sampled bubble. If the total volume of bubbles sampled within a certain period of time exceeds a desired maximum volume, the bubble detector may initiate a system shut down. A bubble detector can be evaluated or calibrated by introducing bubbles into a conduit, detecting the bubbles introduced into the conduit using visual inspection or a bubble detector of known resolution and comparing the results with the examination of a bubble detector under evaluation.

VPermeability of a porous, sheet-like sample is determined using a device that is designed to measure the pressure differential between a first stream of fluid applied across an entire thickness of a test sample and a second stream of fluid applied across an entire thickness of a reference sample. The flow rate for both the test fluid flow system and the reference fluid flow system is determined independently, by measuring a pressure drop throughout the flow system. Data obtained from pressure and flow rate for test and reference fluids are used to calculate percent change in permeability and/or actual permeability using Darcy's Law.

VSystem and process for detecting leaks in sealed articles
p2886
sVabstract
p2887
VA system and method for leak testing a plurality of hermetic electronic packages of the type that have an internal chamber that is isolated from ambient conditions by a seal structure is advantageously designed to be able to calculate the leak rate of each individual device in a manner that is independent of structural manufacturing variances that typically exist within a sampling of such devices. The method preferably involves positioning a plurality of the hermetic electronic packages within a test area, and then stimulating the hermetic electronic packages with a modulated input of energy, such as by varying the ambient pressure about the devices. A property such as the physical position of one portion of a lid of each of the hermetic electronic packages is then sensed. The sensed property is one that is known to change as a first function of the modulated input of energy and also as a second function of pressure conditions within the hermetically sealed internal chamber. The first and second functions are linearly independent of each other. By comparing the stimulation of the devices to the sensed property and by discriminating using the two known functions a leak rate is determined for each individual device that is substantially independent of variances, such as differences in lid thickness that may exist between the different devices. Accordingly, an accurate determination of leak rate may be made with a minimum of calibration.

VA method and apparatus for testing sensors in a fluid flow conduit to verify the accuracy of the flowmeter of which the sensors are a part. Where two similar sensors are employed, active and reference sensor functions are interchanged to verify their functioning accuracy. Alternatively, different stimulation levels can be used to provide a basis for cross-correlation of sensor outputs. A single, or multiple, time-shared sensor can be employed in place of two sensors. Transient or steady state responses are employed. Many sensor types can be used.

VAn integrated LCC-based strain gage sensor, in which at least two LCC traces or strands run across a microcavity within the cylinder head gasket. In one aspect of the present invention, a system is provided comprising a signal source and a microcavity through which an input signal from the signal source passes and which alters the input signal as a result of a response of the microcavity to a strain. An LCC connects the microcavity and the signal source and an input signal propagates through the LCC. The microcavity may comprise one or more reflective surfaces which alters the input signal as a result of a change in a dimension of the microcavity. In another aspect of the invention, the microcavity produces an output signal that has an intensity or frequency different from that of the input signal upon undergoing a deformation.

VFormation tester pretest using pulsed flow rate control
p3051
sVabstract
p3052
VThe present invention is directed to methods and apparatus for using a formation tester to perform a pretest, in a formation having low permeability, by intermittently collecting a portion of fluid at a constant drawdown rate. The drawdown pressure is monitored until a maximum differential pressure is reached between the formation and the tester. Then the piston is stopped until the differential pressure increases to a set value, at which time the piston is restarted. The controlled intermittent operation of the piston continues until a set pretest volume is reached. The modulated drawdown allows for an accurate collection of pressure versus time data that is then used to calculate the formation pressure and permeability. The present invention also finds applicability in logging-while-drilling and measurement-while drilling applications where power conservation is critical.

When a user sets the mode to a control purge mode capable of controlling a maximum flowing amount for constantly maintaining a maximum flowing amount when performing a purge function after the user sets a purge function mode based on a purpose of use of a mass flow controller, a control circuit compares a set value of a flowing amount inputted based on a user's selection with a previously set threshold value and controls a valve for constantly maintaining a maximum flowing amount by switching to a gain resistor for a purge mode having a gain value capable of performing a purge function and controls a valve for thereby accurately controlling a small flowing amount by switching to a gain resistor for a common control mode having a gain value capable of performing a common control function. When a user sets the mode to a purge function mode based on a state of use of a mass flow controller, fully opens a valve and sets a valve open purge mode for obtaining a maximum flowing amount, a control circuit compares a set value of a flowing amount inputted by a user with a previously set threshold value and controls a valve for fully opening a valve for thereby implementing a maximum flowing amount and accurately controlling a small flowing amount.

VArrangement for measuring the level of contents in a container
p3141
sVabstract
p3142
VA continuous measurement of the level of contents in a container is effected by a level measuring device functionong in accordance with the transit time principle by means of waves transmitted from a position located above the highest possible contents level onto the surface of the material in the container. A measuring circuit determines the contents level from the transit time of the useful echo reflected from the material surface. In addition, one or more limit sensors are located at the container, each of which furnishes a signal indicating whether the contents level is above or below a level to be monitored by the limit sensor and which is situated between the minimum and maximum contents levels of the container. The measuring circuit receives the output signals of all limit sensors and uses these output signals to check and eventually to correct the contents level measured value determined by the level measuring device. In particular, the measuring result furnished by the level measuring device can be compared with an exact contents level value every time the contents level reaches the level monitored by a limit sensor whereby the level indication of the limit sensor changes its status. In certain cases, a single limit sensor is sufficient for this purpose, which monitors a contents level which is regularly exceeded or undershot in the normal use of the container.

VA triaxial sensor substrate is adapted for use in measuring the acceleration and angular rate of a moving body along three orthogonal axes. The triaxial sensor substrate includes three individual sensors that are arranged in the plane of the substrate at an angle of 120 degrees with respect to one another. Each sensor is formed from two accelerometers having their sensing axes canted at an angle with respect to the plane of the substrate and further being directed in opposite directions. The rate sensing axes thus lie along three orthogonal axes.\u000aIn order to reduce or eliminate angular acceleration sensitivity, a two substrate configuration may be used. Each substrate includes three accelerometers that are arranged in the plane of the substrate at an angle of 120 degrees with respect to one another. The sensing axes of the accelerometers of the first substrate are canted at an angle with respect to the plane of the first substrate toward the central portion thereof so that they lie along three skewed axes. Similarly, the sensing axes of the accelerometers of the second substrate are canted at an angle with respect to the plane of the second substrate away from the central portion thereof so that they lie along same three but oppositely directed axes. The sensing axes of the first and second substrates are aligned to prevent angular acceleration sensitivity.

VA system for inspecting adhesive in a composite structure, such as for soft or improperly cured regions, includes a transducer and a processing element. The transducer can transmit a signal, such as an ultrasonic signal, into the adhesive such that at least a portion of the ultrasonic signal can propagate through the adhesive, reflect off of an interface between the adhesive and another material, and propagate back through the adhesive. Upon exiting the adhesive, then, the transducer can receive a reflected portion of the ultrasonic signal. Thereafter, the processing element can identify a defect, such as soft or improperly cured regions, in the adhesive upon a relationship of an amplitude of the reflected portion of the reflected ultrasonic signal to a predefined threshold.

sVabstract
p3487
VThe invention concerns a gear motor (), in particular for driving vehicle equipment, comprising a rotor provided with a rotor shaft (), a reduction gearbox housing () containing a cog wheel engaged in an endless screw of the shaft and capable of driving an output member (). The invention is characterised in that it comprises means () for eliminating, under predetermined axial compression (F), all axial play between one end () of the rotor shaft and the housing wall (). Said means can comprise a plug () housed in the housing () end () and a piston (), inserted between the plug () and the shaft () end (); the plug () exerts on the piston () and the shaft () the axial thrust () which is adjusted when being mounted, and is axially locked in the corresponding position by melting the housing () plastic material in the grooves or recesses () of the piston () surface, then in solidifying said plastic material. The suppression of axial play in the rotor shaft () eliminates all the disturbing noises caused by changes in rotational direction.

VParking brake assembly having quiet apply
p3516
sVabstract
p3517
VA parking brake assembly for a vehicle has a mounting bracket, a handle assembly and a clutching mechanism. The mounting bracket has a stop. The handle assembly is pivotally mounted on the mounting bracket for rotation about a first axis. The handle is moveable between a brake applied position and a brake release position. The handle has an actuator. A cam is pivotally mounted on the handle about a second axis offset from the first axis. The cam has a cam surface which varies radially from the second axis. The cam is biased to engage the stop. A clutch spring frictionally engages the cam and is operably connected to the actuator. Movement of the actuator in response to manual manipulation responsively moves the clutch spring to decrease the frictional engagement, thereby enabling the cam to engage with the stop. In response to releasing the actuator, the clutch spring moves to increase frictional engagement with the cam thereby retaining the cam in a position to engage the stop and prop the handle in a braking position.

VA severing apparatus for use with a battery cable is provided. The severing apparatus includes a housing that holds an initiator and a severing element. The battery cable is located through a lateral bore formed in the housing. The severing element is disposed on one side of the battery cable. A deformable blocker can be disposed on the opposite side of the battery cable. When it is desired to sever the battery cable and thereby discontinue the supplying of electrical power by the battery, such as when a predetermined vehicle collision occurs, the initiator is triggered and causes the severing element to move. Movement of the severing element removes a severed battery cable segment. Movement of the severing element and the severed battery cable segment is stopped using the blocker when present. The blocker can be part of a shell that surrounds the housing. Alternatively, the blocker can be held in the housing.

VA tubular member is slidably fitted into a valve body, and is formed with a vacuum valve seat . The tubular member , a valve plunger and the valve body are maintained in their inoperative positions shown by abutment against a key member . A holder is formed with a tapered surface to assist in allowing an elastic deformation of a reaction disc . Immediately after the commencement of operation of a valve mechanism as an input shaft is driven forward, the input shaft and the tubular member are maintained in their inoperative positions until a rear end face of a variable pressure passage abuts against the key member . The operating stroke of an input shaft can be chosen to be less than the operating stroke of an output shaft while preventing the jumping value from increasing to an excessively high value.

VA hydraulic press utilizes a product feed mechanism including a product lifting linkage capable of raising and lowering a product-holding platen while maintaining same in a precise horizontal position during such movement. The hydraulic drive for the lifting and lowering mechanism is capable of moving the platen to any precise vertical position and maintaining same at that position before, during and after press operations. In connection with the lifting and lowering mechanism, a linear motor horizontal drive mechanism is coordinated with the lifting mechanism to enable the product feed system to precisely position the platen anywhere along the travel of the linear motor. The combination of the lifting and lowering mechanism with the linear motor horizontal drive mechanism provides, when operated by an open architecture PC control system, a new and improved product feed mechanism more precisely controllable than heretofore known.

VAn anti-tip arrangement for a mobile system, such as a mobile storage system, in which a movable member is mounted to a rail arrangement. The anti-tip arrangement includes an anti-tip member which is pivotably mounted to the movable member for movement between an operative position and an inoperative position. The anti-tip member has a hook section that is engageable with an engagement surface of the rail arrangement, for preventing tipping of the movable member relative to the rail arrangement. The anti-tip member further includes a retainer section and a tab section that extend in opposite directions from the pivot axis about which the anti-tip member is pivotable. The tab section extends laterally from the pivot axis, and is engageable by a user to enable the user to pivot the anti-tip member to the operative position. The retainer section is offset from the tab section, and is adapted to receive a releasable retainer member, such as a retainer pin, which maintains the anti-tip member in the operative position. The offset of the tab section from the retainer section facilitates the ability of the user to manipulate the anti-tip member for movement to the operative position while engaging the retainer pin with the retainer section.

VMethod and device for capping seedling buds
p4026
sVabstract
p4027
VThe novel seedling bud capping device is easily deployed on a bud of a seedling due to the use of adherent on either edge (rather than a staple), and more particularly due to its predefinedly selective use of adherent to form an inverted conic space around the bud for receiving sunlight and for capturing the bud stem near its base. The paper stock or the adherent used in the bud capping device may be impregnated with a repellent scent to further ward away browsers to protect the seedling. Preferably, the bud capping device is made from a small, e.g. ?5 inch, square piece of water-repellent paper stock having a layer of glue adjacent at least one edge. The stock is protected on the adherent side by another layer of material to be selectively removed. This protective layer is scored and a free segment of the protective backing layer is removed to expose a region of adherent. Because the adherent is wider at the base than at the top, when the device is deployed near a terminus of a seedling bud, it grasps the base of the bud's stem at a fulcrum of an inverted cone while leaving open the top of the device for exposure to sunlight. The bud capping device prevents browsing of a fragile seedling while permitting the seedling to thrive. The bud capping device may be affixed with a pull-tab scent device of any suitable configuration, preferably with a slow-release animal repellent. The device may be arranged and mass-produced in laminar sheets, cut and formed into rolls for easy dispensing.

sVabstract
p4072
VA device and method for raising sunken objects such as crates, small boats, vessels and ships including a platform equipped with winches to lower down a basket net and a frame supporting a cryogenic apparatus to the vicinity of the object. The cryogenic apparatus is adapted to pump surrounding water through a freezing unit to reduce its temperature to below freezing and then form a stream of overcooled water directed over the sunken object to form a layer of ice about it. The basket net contains provisions to allow its closure under the object once it is lifted off the sea floor. Once enough ice is formed, the object is lifted to the surface. On average, the capacity of the cryogenic apparatus is such that a 1 ton object can be lifted in about 3 hours. Remote monitoring and control means are provided for the operator to observe and direct the operation of the device. The device is especially advantageous in dealing with explosive objects such as old and unwanted sea mines, torpedoes and alike.

VPersonal watercraft having a preformed rub rail
p4086
sVabstract
p4087
VPersonal watercraft having extruded rigid rub rails that can be curved in vertical and horizontal dimensions to provide complex geometries in watercraft. One rub rail has a pair of resilient opposed converging wings extending outwardly from the rub rail to form an open channel along the rub rail length. A first bottom lip can extend inwardly to hug the downwardly facing surface of the top deck. A second lip can curve upward and inward beneath the first inwardly extending bottom lip. The second lip can provide an increased ability to hug sharp horizontally curved corners of the watercraft without wrinkling, for example, the rear corners of the watercraft. The rub rail can be both vertically and horizontally curved in the same region and be affixed to a vertical bond flange. In some personal watercraft, the rub rail is formed of a rigid material having a Shore A hardness of at least about 90. The complex geometries of some rub rails are created by heating the rub rail, securing the rub rail to a forming jig or fixture, and allowing the rub rail to cool. The cooled rub rail can thus have the preformed, complex geometry of the top deck to which it is to be affixed, while having a transverse profile than cannot be made by injection molding.

p4131
sVabstract
p4132
VIn an outboard motor steering system for an outboard motor mounted on a stern of a boat and having an internal combustion engine at its upper portion and a propeller with a rudder at its lower portion powered by the engine to propel and steer the boat, a controller is connected to an actuator to rotate the outboard motor relative to the boat, and controls the actuator in such a manner that steered angle of the outboard motor relative to a steering angle inputted through a steering wheel becomes a predetermined ratio that is changed such that the steered angle of the outboard motor relative to the steering angle decreases with increasing moving speed of the boat. Alternatively, a switch is provided to be manipulated by the operator and generating a signal indicative of an instruction to change the steered angle of the outboard motor when manipulated; and the controller controlling the actuator to steer the outboard motor to an angle in response to inputted steering angle when the switch is not manipulated, while controlling the actuator to change the steered angle when the switch is manipulated. With this, the burdens of the operator are lightened and the steering feel is improved, in particular when the operator steers the boat to approach or leave a quay.

VAn odor-emitting port is provided in a housing member composed mainly of an inorganic material. An odorous material is contained in the housing member, and the odor-emitting port is sealed with a low-melting metal to constitute a heat-sensitive odor-emitting component. In this heat-sensitive odor-emitting component, as soon as the temperature of a heat generation site has reached a predetermined value, the low-melting metal is instantaneously melted down to open the odor-emitting port through which the odorous material contained in the housing member is immediately spread around the odor-emitting component. Therefore, the odor-emitting component is highly sensitive to temperature. Further, since the housing member is formed of an inorganic material, the long-term stability can be improved.

VMethod and apparatus for replacing or modifying a postscript built-in
p4401
sVabstract
p4402
VAn improved printer is provided in which one of the "built-in" resident fonts can be effectively replaced by downloading from a host computer (into either Flash memory or the printer's hard disk drive) new or modified data under the same font descriptor as the built-in font. After the replacement font has been received by the printer and stored into a non-volatile memory storage device, the user can choose whether to use the replacement font or the built-in font for a particular document, by use of a printer setting named the "Font Priority." This Font Priority setting has the values of either "Resident" or "Flash/Disk." When the Font Priority setting is set to "Resident," the printer preserves Adobe compatibility by having the PostScript interpreter search the virtual memory first to locate a font that is requested by a print job. If the particular font is found, no other font memory storage device is searched and the copy of the font reference in the virtual memory is selected. If the Font Priority is set to "Flash/Disk," the PostScript interpreter will still search for the requested font in virtual memory. However, if the interpreter finds that a resident font has been requested, then the non-volatile memory storage devices are searched for a replacement version of that font. If a replacement font is found, it is loaded into virtual memory and will now be used to print the document (instead of the original built-in resident font).

VDither method and printing apparatus
p4416
sVabstract
p4417
VA ROM in the control circuit of a color printer stores a threshold matrix. The individual elements of the threshold matrix correspond to print dots, the number of which is X.times.Y and which form 1 pixel in the original image. Values t (x, y) which are integral numbers not less than 0 are assigned one to each of the individual elements in a predetermined order. Using the threshold matrix, the CPU of the control circuit creates mask patterns for representing halftones. A value of 1 is subtracted from the tone number allotted to the tone of color of a pixel in an image to be printed, and the resultant value is substituted for a variable G. When a gradation for image data representing the pixel is given as "g", the condition required for setting ON (transferring toner to print) the dot specified by the coordinates (x, y) in the pixel in the case of the gradation "g" is expressed by the following formula (6):

VMethod and device for starting an internal combustion engine having direct injection
p4746
sVabstract
p4747
VIn a direct start of an internal combustion engine, sufficient energy may need to be released in a first combustion to set the internal combustion engine into motion, if possible without the assistance of an additional assembly, such as an electromotive starter. For this reason, the carburetion of an air-fuel mixture, made up of the air mass present in a combustion chamber and the fuel mass injected therein, is of great importance. In order to improve the mixture formation during a start, e.g., during a warm start of an internal combustion engine, the fuel mass required for a mixture formation is introduced into the combustion chamber, in full or in part, already prior to a start phase by at least one injection, and the mixture formation may be improved in this manner by vaporization of the introduced fuel mass.

VController for control at engine startup
p4791
sVabstract
p4792
VA control unit for engine startup includes a throttle valve, a bypass air quantity-regulating valve, an ignition coil, a bypass air quantity controller, an ignition timing feedback controller, and a multi-spark controller. The throttle valve is disposed in an intake passage of an engine to control intake air quantity. The bypass air quantity-regulating valve controls the air quantity in a bypass passage that bypasses the throttle valve. The ignition coil permits an ignition plug of a same cylinder of the engine to produce multi-sparking during one cycle. The bypass air quantity controller controls the bypass air quantity-regulating valve such that the engine speed is at a target engine speed. The ignition timing feedback controller performs feedback control for the ignition coil such that the ignition timing of the ignition plug is at a target ignition timing. The multi-spark controller controls the ignition coil such that the ignition plug performs multi-spark as necessary. In operation, the control unit reduces the amount of unused hydrocarbons and improves the drivability at startup of a cold engine.

VIntake control apparatus for internal combustion engine
p4806
sVabstract
p4807
VAn intake control apparatus is configured to control a variable valve operating mechanism and an opening degree of a throttle valve. The variable valve operating mechanism varies the valve lift characteristic of the intake valves to control the intake air amount into the cylinders of the engine. The throttle valve produces a negative pressure inside the collector, but in a valve control region including medium loads, the pressure inside the collector is fixed at a weak negative pressure and the intake air amount is controlled by varying the valve lift characteristic of the intake valves. In an internal EGR priority region of low loads, the negative pressure is strengthened somewhat and the lift/duration of the intake valves is increased. When the engine is cold, the negative pressure is adjusted to be close to atmospheric pressure and the lift/duration of the intake valves is reduced.

VAn electronic throttle control system is provided, which comprises an accelerator pedal position sensor, a control unit, and a biasing mechanism. The accelerator pedal position sensor detects a position of an accelerator pedal. The throttle actuator actuates a throttle valve to rotate. The control unit determines a target throttle position based on the accelerator pedal position, and controls an operation of the throttle actuator in accordance with the determined target throttle position. The biasing mechanism provides rotational force to the throttle valve such that an opening angle of the throttle valve while the throttle actuator is not powered is greater than a predetermined idle opening angle.

VAn engine control system for monitoring torque increase during cylinder deactivation for a displacement on demand (DOD) engine includes a throttle and a controller. The controller adjusts a preload of the throttle prior to a cylinder deactivation event and determines whether a DOD fault is present during the cylinder deactivation event. The controller one of operates the engine without the preload in the deactivated mode and switches the engine back to the activated mode if the fault is present for a predetermined time. The controller cancels the preload if the DOD fault is present and resets the preload if the predetermined period has not expired. The DOD fault includes one of an engine speed fault, a transmission gear fault and a fueled cylinder fault.

VPositive stop diaphragm assembly for fuel pressure regulator
p4896
sVabstract
p4897
VA fuel pressure regulator for use with an internal combustion engine includes a housing, a valve assembly in the housing, an elastic diaphragm connecting the valve assembly to the housing, a stop on one of the housing and the support and a spring between the housing and the valve assembly. The housing includes an inlet, an outlet and a longitudinal axis. The valve assembly is intermediate the inlet and the outlet and selectively opens fluid communication between the inlet to the outlet when a fuel pressure at the inlet is at least equal to an over-pressure amount. The valve assembly is displaceable along the longitudinal axis by an opening distance when a fuel pressure at least equal the over-pressure amount acts on the diaphragm so that the diaphragm does not exceed its yield strength. The diaphragm is in fluid communication with the inlet and elastically displaceable along the longitudinal axis up to a maximum distance. The stop is spaced from the other of the housing and the support along the longitudinal axis by a traveling distance when the valve assembly closes the fluid communication between the inlet and the outlet. The traveling distance is at most equal to the maximum distance and substantially greater than the opening distance. The spring biases the valve assembly to close the fluid communication between the inlet and the outlet when the fuel pressure at the inlet is less than the over-pressure amount.

VHigh speed exhaust gas recirculation valve
p5001
sVabstract
p5002
VIn order to minimize pollutants such as Nox, internal combustion engines typically include an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve that can be used to redirect a portion of exhaust gases to an intake conduit, such as an intake manifold, so that the redirected exhaust gases will be recycled. It is desirable to have an EGR valve with fast-acting capabilities, and it is also desirable to have the EGR valve take up as little space as possible. An exhaust gas recirculation valve is provided that includes an exhaust passage tube, a valve element pivotally mounted within the exhaust passage tube, a linear actuator; and a gear train. The gear train includes a rack gear operatively connected to the linear actuator, and at least one rotatable gear meshing with the rack gear and operatively connected to the valve element to cause rotation of the valve element upon actuation of the linear actuator. The apparatus provides a highly compact package having a high-speed valve actuation capability.

VMethod for monitoring the functioning of a NOx sensor arranged in an exhaust gas channel of an internal combustion engine
p5016
sVabstract
p5017
VThe invention relates to a method for monitoring the functioning of an NOx sensor, which is arranged in an exhaust gas channel of an internal combustion engine and is located downstream from an NOx storage catalytic converter. The aim of the invention is to detect the faulty functioning of the NOx sensor in a simple manner in order to be able to take appropriate measures if necessary. To this end, the mass of NOx absorbed by the NOx storage catalytic converter is determined within a diagnostic period using a measurement signal of the NOx sensor. At the same time, an absorbed NOx target mass is calculated using a model for the NOx storage catalytic converter. A ratio of the NOx mass to the NOx target mass is then compared to predetermined limit values to determine the functioning of the NOx sensor. The aim of the invention is alternatively accomplished by measuring a duration time for a complete NOx regeneration of the NOx storage catalytic converter. A specified duration time is also calculated for the NOx regeneration using a model for the NOx storage catalytic converter and using a measured or calculated NOx load state. A ratio of the measured duration time to the specified duration time is then compared to predetermined limit values to determine the functioning of the NOx sensor.

VA urinary-control device for inhibiting male incontinence includes upper and lower clamping members each having a substantially arcuate inner surface adapted to be disposed about a portion of a penis. A hinge allows articulated movement of the upper and lower clamping members relative to one another. A self-locking mechanism is adapted to adjustably lock the clamping members together, thereby mounting the device to the penis. A protrusion is formed on the inner surface of the lower clamping member and extends toward the inner surface of the upper clamping member to collapse the urethra to inhibit flow of urine therethrough when the device is mounted to the penis. A plurality of vein-relief portions are disposed spaced from one another and formed on the inner surface of the upper clamping member such that the device does not constrict blood flow through the penis when the device is mounted to the penis.

VEmbodiments of the invention include a megasonic energy cleaning apparatus that has the ability to rotate the wafer to be cleaned, as well as rotate the cleaning probe during the cleaning process. Rotating the cleaning probe while the wafer is being cleaned is effective to increase the cleaning action of the apparatus while also minimizing damage to the wafer. Curved grooves, such as a spiral groove, can be etched into the cleaning probe to minimize forming harmful waves that could potentially cause damage to the wafer surface or to structures already made on the surface. Using a cleaning probe having a curved groove while also rotating the cleaning probe effectively cleans particles from a wafer while also limiting damage to the surface of the wafer.

VThis invention relates to a vibrating abrasive cleaning apparatus and method which is powered by at least one electric motor specially fabricated to the cleaning container assembly mounted on a rigid square tubing frame on one side by compression springs, on the opposite side by tension springs. The compression springs and tension springs have a different spring rate which produces better rolling of the media and therefore, faster circulation and cleaning. The specially fabricated electric motor attached to the cleaning container provides for enhanced oscillation and much greater cleaning capabilities thereby reducing the cleaning time. The entire vibrating assembly sits on a base and has a lid operated by a cable and counterweight for ease in loading the container for oscillation of the parts.

VPartially closed microfluidic system and microfluidic driving method
p5346
sVabstract
p5347
VThis specification disclosed a partially closed microfluidic system and a fluid driving method. The microfluidic system is comprised of a substrate with microfluidic elements and a thin film. A feature of this structure is that the thin film is elastic and deformable. It has a single opening corresponding to a vent hole on the substrate, thus forming a partially closed microfluidic system. The substrate is designed to have several positions for micro fluid elements and deformable chambers and uses micro channels to form a complete network. Since the thin film is elastic and deformable, one is able to impose a pressure on the thin film above the deformable chambers in this partially closed microfluidic system to drive the fluid into motion. Once the pressure is released, the fluid flows back to its original configuration.

VA new and improved, multi-phase pressure control valve for facilitating quick and accurate attainment and stabilization of gas pressure inside a semiconductor fabrication process chamber such as an etch chamber or CVD chamber. In one embodiment, the multi-phase pressure control valve is a butterfly-type valve which includes outer and inner vanes that independently control flow of gases from a process chamber to a vacuum pump. The larger-diameter outer vane stabilizes gas pressures within a large range, whereas the inner vane stabilizes pressure within a smaller range. In another embodiment, the multi-phase pressure control valve is a gate-type valve which may include a pivoting outer vane and an inner vane slidably disposed with respect to the outer vane for exposing a central gas flow opening in the outer vane.

p5376
sVabstract
p5377
VA pressure relief system for detecting and abating an overpressure in a pressurized fluid. The system includes a pressure response assembly that has a pressure responsive member, such as a buckling pin, configured to buckle when a predetermined force is applied to the member. When the buckling pin buckles, a piston slides to expose an inlet to a communication path to an actuator assembly. The actuator assembly includes a pair of sliders that move from a retracted position to an extended position when pressurized fluid enters an actuator assembly housing. The sliders have a rack that turns a pinion when the sliders move from the retracted position to the extended position. The pinion is rigidly attached to a rotatable actuator shaft. Rotation of the actuator shaft causes a valve assembly to open or close to direct the pressurized fluid through an overpressure path.

VRegulator with erosion resistant seal assemblies
p5391
sVabstract
p5392
VThe regulator connects to a high pressure fluid supply and regulates the pressure to a downstream apparatus. If an over-pressure occurs, it is vented to atmosphere. An elongate control stem engages a supply seal assembly and a vent seal assembly and moves axially with respect to these seal assemblies to achieve regulation and venting. During high fluid flow, the supply seal assembly and the vent seal assembly are not in the fluid flow path of the regulator which makes the seal assemblies more resistant to erosion from fluid flow. The fluid flow path through the regulator is partially in hollow passageways in the elongate control stem.

VApparatus for inhibiting fuels from flowing out of fuel tanks
p5421
sVabstract
p5422
VAn apparatus is for inhibiting fuels from flowing out of fuel tanks, and includes a housing having an evaporator opening and a fuel opening, a double-floating valve and a cover having a cylinder-shaped liquid receptacle. Alternatively, the apparatus can include a housing having an evaporator opening, a fuel opening and a substantially cylinder-shaped dam, a double-floating valve, and a cover free from the cylinder-shaped liquid receptacle. The apparatus can securely inhibit liquid fuels from flowing into a canister even when liquid fuels spout through the valve hole and the evaporator opening, because liquid fuels collide with the liquid receptacle or the dam to return back into fuel tanks through the evaporator opening.

VAn apparatus and method for inerting the gas present in the ullage region of a storage tank for combustible liquids, e.g., a fuel tank containing a hydrocarbon liquid fuel, utilizes a molecular sieve zone (, beds ) which either (a) selectively adsorbs oxygen from the ullage gas to provide an oxygen-depleted return ullage gas, or (b) selectively adsorbs nitrogen from the ullage gas, which nitrogen is desorbed and conveyed by a purge gas to provide a nitrogen-enriched gas. The return ullage gas or the nitrogen-enriched gas is flowed to the ullage region () in quantity sufficient to render the overall composition of gas in the ullage region () non-combustible and non-explosive. The apparatus may include a compressor () or a vacuum pump to flow the ullage gas through the system, and a valving arrangement () is used to control the flow of gases. Operation may be intermittent or continuous and may comprise pressure-swing adsorption/desorption to place one of molecular sieve beds () on-line to adsorb oxygen or nitrogen from the ullage gas, while the other of molecular sieve beds () is off-line being regenerated.

VA device for controlling fluid flow between an evaporative emission space of a fuel tank and a fuel vapor collection canister that includes a housing, a valve, a seal, an electric actuator, an electric transducer, and an electrical connector. The housing includes a first port, a second port, and a fluid flow path that extends between the first and second ports. The first port is adapted for receiving fluid flow from the evaporative emission space and is at a first pressure level. The second port is adapted for supplying fluid flow to the fuel vapor collection canister and is at a second pressure level. The valve is movable along an axis with respect to the housing between a first configuration, a second configuration, and an intermediate configuration between the first and second configurations. The first configuration permits substantially unrestricted fluid flow between the first and second ports. The second configuration prevents fluid flow between the first and second ports. The seal is located at an interface between the housing and the valve and includes an annular lip, which projects obliquely with respect to the axis in the first configuration of the valve. The electric actuator is disposed within the housing and is operatively coupled to the valve element. The electric transducer is disposed within the housing and is in fluid communication with the fluid flow path. The electric transducer senses the first pressure level. The electrical connector is disposed on the housing. The electrical connector includes a first set of terminals, which are in electrical communication with the electric actuator and a second set of terminals, which are in electrical communication with the electric transducer.

VConductance valve and pressure-to-conductance transducer method and apparatus
p5481
sVabstract
p5482
VA device for interrupting or throttling undesired ionic transport through a fluid network is disclosed. The device acts as a fluid valve by reversibly generating a fixed ?bubble? in the conducting solvent solution carried by the network. The device comprises a porous hydrophobic structure filling a portion of a connecting channel within the network and optionally incorporates flow restrictor elements at either end of the porous structure that function as pressure isolation barriers, and a fluid reservoir connected to the region of the channel containing the porous structure. Also included is a pressure pump connected to the fluid reservoir. The device operates by causing the pump to vary the hydraulic pressure to a quantity of solvent solution held within the reservoir and porous structure. At high pressures, most or all of the pores of the structure are filled with conducting liquid so the ionic conductance is high. At lower pressures, only a fraction of the pores are filled with liquid, so ionic conductivity is lower. Below a threshold pressure, the porous structure contains only vapor, so there is no liquid conduction path. The device therefore effectively throttles ionic transport through the porous structure and acts as a ?conductance valve? or ?pressure-to-conductance? transducer within the network.

VThe invention relates to a method for producing gilled metal pipes. According to the method, at least one continuous, gill-forming strip is applied to a rotating pipe body at a tangent and unwound onto the pipe body in an approximately helical line. The side of the strip facing towards the pipe body is connected to the pipe surface by a welding device, using an additional material. The welding process is optimized and the finishing quality increased by molding a web that is bent at right angles to the strip that forms the gills before the strip is wound onto the pipe body. The strip is preferably bent into a U-shape and the web, which runs between the two limbs of the U-shape, is guided flatly onto the pipe body.

p5512
VAn electrically conductive confined space ventilation conduit formed of a substantially rigid non-metallic conductive material, such as plastic, and a related process for ventilating an enclosure accessed by a manhole or other port. In one embodiment, the conduit has a pair of outer cylindrical sections and a central section having a cross-sectional shape of a crescent or a segment of a circle where it passes through a port to provide a minimum of obstruction for men and equipment passing through the port. Intermediate sections of varying cross-section connect the central section to the cylindrical outer sections so that the outer sections are offset from the axis of the manhole. The central section is preferably configured to obstruct no more than about 10 percent of a standard manhole opening, while causing either no air flow rate reduction, or a reduction of no more than about 10 percent as compared to the flow rate through a cylindrical conduit similar to said outer sections. The conduit is preferably formed of a conductive or electrically dissipative polyethylene polymer material to allow static electricity to be conducted from the conduit to ground. In a preferred embodiment, a connecting device for connecting the conduit to electrical ground is connected to the conduit. A grounding circuit kit and method of grounding the conduit is also disclosed.

VLaminate cartridge
p5841
sVabstract
p5842
VAn overcoat application apparatus is used to transfer an overcoat material from a donor support to a printed media. The overcoat application apparatus in this case includes a laminate cartridge, a donor supply reel, a donor guide bar, a heated fuser roller, a pressure roller, a peel bar, and a take-up reel. The donor supply reel provides a continuous source of donor plus overcoat material. The donor guide bar guides printed media and the donor plus overcoat into a nip created by forcing the heated fuser roller and pressure roller together. The heated fuser roller is used to transport the printed media and donor through the nip and apply heat to the donor and printed media. The pressure roller is used to apply pressure to the fuser roller in order to produce the mechanical nip. The nip plus the heat causes the overcoat material on the donor to be transferred to the printed media. After the fusing process, the peel bar is used to separate the support layer of the laminate carrying donor from the printed media that is now coated with the overcoat material. The laminate cartridge has two spool holders, the first spool holder supports a spool of the laminate carrying donor material and the second spool holder supports a spool of the substrate after the overcoat material is used.

VApparatus for automatically debonding, processing, and handling fragile slider rows
p5856
sVabstract
p5857
VAn automatic thermal debonding tool removes slider rows from a stainless steel processing fixture. The tool uses a bimodal pitch adjustment and a mechanical row detainment mechanism to remove the rows from the fixture. The tool allow full control of all critical process parameters such as accurate and repeatable row placement; controlled temperature and heat flow; controlled mechanical removal pressure; temporal control and variability; clean and contaminant-free working area; and full electrostatic discharge grounding and compatible materials. The bimodal pitch adjustment feature allows for continual, high-speed removal of the ceramic rows from the fixture after an automated heating cycle is complete. As the rows are removed, they are accurately placed into the detainment mechanism for the next process step.

VShade operator
p5916
sVabstract
p5917
VAn operator for a window or like shade serves to turn a shade roller to a new desired position as a result of a torque applied from a manually operable source, such as a chain operated wheel. The device includes a helical spring that is seated within a fixed bushing with its outer surface in contact with an inner cylindrical surface of the bushing. When torque is applied from the manually operable source, one overlapping end of the spring is moved away from its other end to reduce the spring diameter and hence release any frictional engagement of the spring with the bushing, thus allowing the torque to rotate the spring, which rotation is transmitted to the roller. However, when no such manually applied torque is present, the spring and the roller remain effectively locked in position. Any torque applied from the roller due to the weight of a partly lowered shade acts to tend to increase the spring diameter and thus to ensure a binding frictional engagement between the bushing and the spring.

VA method for making sand particle foundry mold members. Sand particles are coated with an aqueous dispersion of a suitable binder material such as a gelatin gel. The moist gelatin coated particles are gravity fed into a pattern box for the mold member and subjected to multi-axis vibration to pack the sand in the pattern box. The moist sand is then heated with radio frequency energy to promote binder flow to the corners of the particles, and air flow is initiated to transport water from the mass of particles to harden the mass of particles into the mold member.

VCompact ductless cooling with heat exchangers
p5946
sVabstract
p5947
VHeat is removed from an equipment enclosure using a recirculating air flow loop that is confined entirely within the enclosure. A segment of the air flow loop is directed onto heat-generating components, contained within housings mounted inside the enclosure. A segment of the air flow loop carries heated air to a heat exchanger, which transfers heat to flowing liquid. A portion of the air flow loop traverses through the ductless air volume confined between the housings and inner walls of the enclosure. Blowers to drive the air flow are typically mounted within or on a housing. Heat exchangers are also typically mounted on a housing. Embodiments of the present invention enable a single heat exchanger or multiple heat exchangers to cool multiple electronic components without complicated ducting and without exhausting heated air into a controlled manufacturing environment, e.g. a clean room.

p6052
VA packing element, which is a composite structure, contains the sealing portion to minimize extrusion. The element is retained in tension when running in to minimize damage. In the preferred embodiment, a collapsing sleeve transfers setting force applied at one end, to the opposite end to avoid the problem of bunching up the element adjacent to where it is being compressed which could, if not addressed, result in insufficiently low sealing contact pressure in regions remote from where the pushing force is applied.

VMethod for improving well quality
p6066
sVabstract
p6067
VA method of improving the quality of liquid coming from a well that has a pump and pipe assembly. The method includes identifying a region of the well that is low in contamination and a region of the well that is high in contamination, and modifying the pump and pipe assembly so that suction of the assembly is enhanced in the region that is low in contamination and inhibited in the region that is high in contamination. The method also includes cleaning the well in the region of low contamination. Modifying the pump and pipe assembly includes coupling a suction control device to the pump and pipe assembly, and positioning the suction control device in the region of low contamination, and forming a barrier between the region of low contamination and the region of high contamination by attaching a flow control disk to the pump and pipe assembly.

VA method and system for activating a device at a particular orientation in a casing are disclosed. The casing has a bias, for example a lower side due to tilt, that defines a default angle in the casing, for example a point along a wall of the casing where objects will rest due to gravity. The method includes providing a magnetic sensor at a known angle in the device relative to the angle at which a device function occurs. For example, the angle at which a perforating gun perforates the casing is a device function angle. The method further includes lowering the device into the casing. The method further includes determining the offset of the device from the casing at the known angular position from an output of the magnet sensor. The device can then be activated.

VExpansion assembly for a tubular expander tool, and method of tubular expansion
p6111
sVabstract
p6112
VAn improved expansion assembly for an expander tool is provided. The expander tool is used to expand a surrounding tubular body within a wellbore. Accordingly, a method for expanding a surrounding tubular is also provided. The expansion assembly first comprises a piston disposed within a recess of the expander tool. The top surface of the piston closely receives a pad. The pad is held in close proximity to the top surface of the piston such that it does not rotate about a shaft. This arrangement reduces the geometric size of the expansion assembly, affording a larger inner diameter for the hollow bore of the expander tool itself. At least one reinforcement member is disposed on or within the pad to strengthen the pad during an expansion operation. The reinforcement member is fabricated from a durable material, and is arranged along the pad in the area of contact with the surrounding tubular during an expansion operation.

VRotary percussion device for a drill column
p6216
sVabstract
p6217
VThe inventive rotary percussion device (1) used for driving at least one drill column (2) disposes of a percussion device (6) and a rotary device (5) and of an insertion end (3), which is rotatably mounted in a device body (8) and which has an axial boring, in which a percussion piston (4) is displaceably mounted. The insertion end (3), which is connected to the drill column (2) by a connection piece (33), is driven by the rotary device (5), and the percussion piston (4) mounted in the insertion end (3) is driven independently thereof by the percussion device (6). The percussion energy transmitted to the drill column (2) via the percussion piston (4) has, as a result, largely reduced influences upon the insertion end (3) that, according to the invention, is decoupled from the percussion device (5) so that premature material fatigue is prevented. In addition, the noise emissions occurring during the operation of the inventive rotary percussion device (1) are largely reduced.

VMethod and apparatus for varying the density of drilling fluids in deep water oil drilling applications
p6246
sVabstract
p6247
VA method and apparatus for controlling drilling mud density at a location either at the seabed (or just above the seabed) or alternatively below the seabed of wells in deep water and ultra deep water applications combines a base fluid of lesser density than the mud required at the wellhead to produce a diluted mud in the riser. By combining the appropriate quantities of drilling mud with base fluid, a riser mud density at or near the density of seawater may be achieved. A wellhead injection device for attachment to the wellhead is used for injecting the base fluid into the rising drilling mud at a location below the seabed. The riser charging lines are used to carry the low density base fluid to the injection device for injection into the drilling mud below the seabed. The cuttings are brought to the surface with the diluted mud and separated in the usual manner. The diluted mud is then passed through a centrifuge system to separate the heavier drilling mud from the lighter base fluid.

VA control system and method for accelerating the warm-up operation of a hybrid vehicle while preferably using the characteristics of the hybrid vehicle. The system comprises a warm-up accelerating section for accelerating warm-up of the engine by controlling the ignition timing of the engine according to a temperature of water for cooling the engine; and a power generation control section for performing power generation using the motor according to a remaining charge of a battery of the vehicle. The warm-up accelerating section has an ignition timing correcting section for correcting the ignition timing according to an amount of generated power which is controlled by the power generation control section. Therefore, in comparison with the case of performing the warm-up operation by simply using both the ignition timing retardation and the power generation, the ignition timing can be close to the optimum point, thereby improving the combustion efficiency.

An electric retractor has a DC motor for retracting and protracting the seatbelt. An MPU applies voltage having a predetermined waveform to the DC motor, and then detects a waveform of current flowing to the DC motor. The MPU carries out fault diagnosis of the DC motor, based upon the detected waveform of current when the voltage having the predetermined waveform is applied to the DC motor. Thus, accurate fault diagnosis of the apparatus can be achieved.

VA rotating actuator includes a shaft () and a mechanical stop device () for generating a stop to limit the rotation of the shaft in a direction of rotation. The stop device acts upon the shaft to prevent the shaft from rotating further in the direction of rotation by blocking the shaft using a stop device acting mechanically on the shaft while enabling rotation of the shaft in a direction of rotation counter to the stop with slip in a stop arrangement. The slip is configured such that movement of the shaft in the direction of rotation counter to the stop is detectable. The stop device may include two independently triggered, mechanical stop devices. One stop device acts as a stop for limiting the rotation of the shaft to the right, and the other stop device acts as a stop for limiting the rotation of the shaft to the left.

VRotatable transfer track device
p6621
sVabstract
p6622
VA transfer conveying mechanism includes a transfer track supported by a transfer support arm. Above the transfer track is a chain guide and depending therefrom are transfer sprockets. Extending about the transfer sprockets is an endless chain having at least one push dog attached thereto. The push dogs move the carrier into and across the transfer track. Attached above the transfer support arm is a sprocket, which is rotatably connected to a pivot plate. The pivot plate is attached to a structural steel assembly from which the transfer conveying mechanism depends. As the sprocket is rotated by a motor and chain transmission, the transfer conveying mechanism rotates in order to direct a carrier to a desired conveyor track.

The first screener is mounted to the support frame and extends longitudinally thereon. The first screener has an inlet for receiving the bulk material containing large-sized, medium-sized, and small-sized particles. The first screener also has a first outlet for releasing large-sized particles and a second outlet for releasing medium-sized and small-sized particles. The first screener is used for screening the bulk material along a first direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the support frame. The second screener is mounted to the support frame and extends longitudinally thereon. The second screener has an inlet for receiving medium-sized and small-sized particles conveyed from the first screener and also has a first outlet for releasing medium-sized particles and a second outlet for releasing small-sized particles. The second screener is used for screening the medium-sized particles from the small-sized particles along a second direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the support frame. The mobile screening unit enables to screen bulk material containing particles of different sizes into at least three different piles, each pile containing particles of substantially the same size.

VSpacer and filter assembly utilizing the spacer
p6861
sVabstract
p6862
VAn end cap of a filter element has canted fins in an annular space between a filter element and filter housing for imparting a rotary motion to a fluid prior to the fluid passing through the filter element. The end cap includes a plurality of axially extending legs upstream of the fins, which legs engage a nutplate. Spaces between the legs provide an inlet allowing dirty fluid to flow to the outside surfaces of the filter element. The fins remove large particles from the fluid by centrifugal force so that large particles do not add to the contaminant load in the filter elements.

p6936
sVabstract
p6937
VAn internal reinforcement structure of a plastic fuel tank resists deformation of opposing walls of the fuel tank and provides an integral, and directionally sensitive, stress relief feature when pre-determined forces are exceeded. The stress relief feature is contained within a fuel chamber of the fuel tank defined by the opposing walls. Each wall has an inward projecting indentation of the structure which engage one-another at their distal ends or bottom portions, preferably, via a welded plastic engagement area. The indentations have a consistent wall thickness which has a higher cross-sectional area than the stress relief feature causing the stress relief feature to tear as opposed to the tank walls thereby assuring fuel tank integrity.

VAdjustable leather rifle sling
p7071
sVabstract
p7072
VThe adjustable leather rifle sling is a shoulder sling for carrying a rifle, shotgun, or other long gun. The adjustable leather rifle sling is formed from a single leather strap. A large adjustable loop is formed in one end of the leather strap, and secured by a slide-lock knot. The slide-lock knot is formed by cutting two slits into the leather strap, to form three small strips. Each of the small strips is turned 90? so that three small bands are formed perpendicular to the length of the leather sling. The adjustable loop is made by passing an end of the leather strap through the bands of the slide-lock knot. Thus, an adjustable loop is formed in the adjustable leather rifle sling without the need for clasps, slides, buckles or other fittings.

p7222
VA method of joining metal and metal, or metal and ceramic parts, wherein a first metal part is selected and then processed to form a bond coat that will effectively bond to a sealing material which in turn bonds to a second metal or ceramic part without degrading under the operating conditions of electrochemical devices. Preferred first metal parts include alumina forming alloys from the group consisting of ferritic stainless steels (such as Fecralloys), austinetic stainless steels, and superalloys, and chromia forming alloys formed of ferritic stainless steels. In the case of chromia forming ferritic stainless steels, this bond coat consists of a thin layer of alumina formed on the surface, with a diffusion layer between the first metal part and this thin layer. The bond coat provides a good bonding surface for a sealing layer of glass, braze or combinations thereof, while at the same time the diffusion layer provides a durable bond between the thin alumina layer and the first metal part. In the case of alumina forming alloys, the bond coat consists of cauliflower-like growths of an aluminum oxide nodules embedded in the surface of the alumina forming alloys.

VMolded memory module and method of making the module absent a substrate support
p7401
sVabstract
p7402
VAn improved memory module and method of manufacture are presented. The memory module takes on the same outer dimensions as conventional memory cards. The memory module includes an integrated circuit and a conductor encased within molded resin. The conductor can be taken from a tape or a lead frame, and can include bumps or wires extending from the conductor to corresponding bonding pads on the integrated circuit. The bonded integrated circuit can thereafter be placed within a cavity formed inside a mold housing, where resin may be injected to form the memory module. The conductor can also be shaped so as to extend on multiple planes from the connection point on or near the bonding pad to an edge connector residing near one edge only of the memory module. The conductor is thereby connected to the integrated circuit and provides slide-in, releasable coupling to a receptor.

p7416
sVabstract
p7417
VThe present invention relates to identification documents and smart cards. In one implementation, we provide a smart identification document including a document core. The document core is printed and laminated. The laminated core is milled to create a cavity. An integrated circuitry module is provided in the cavity. In one implementation, the cavity includes an upper cavity and a lower cavity. A laminate layer houses the upper cavity while the lower cavity extends into the document core. The upper cavity's aperture exceeds the aperture of the lower cavity resulting in a ledge in the laminate layer. A portion of the module may rest on the ledge, while another portion of the module may extend into the lower cavity. In another implementation, we provide a contactless smart card including a multi-layered structure. The structure includes a carrier layer including the smart card electronics. The carrier can be permeable (like a mesh or scrim) so that additional layers may be laminated into or through the carrier layer. A multi-layer structure provides a enhanced durability and helps protect the smart card electronics. In still another implementation, we provide a PET-based identification document. The PET-based document includes favorable durability and earth-friendly characteristics.

VMethod and apparatus for dynamic tracking of a belt as it is built on two rotatable drums separated by a center-to-center distance, especially during the cording process. In one embodiment, both edges of a belt component are temporarily equipped with corded edge binding which is engaged in a gap formed between upper and lower tracking wheels to provide proper alignment of the belt during the cording process and subsequent building steps. In a first tracking assembly, one pair of tracking wheels operates to constrain and align one edge of the belt and another pair, transversely spaced from the first pair, operates to constrain and align the second edge of the belt in the upper span of the belt immediately prior to the belt being positioned on a first drum. In each wheel pair, the axes are biased toward one another and slightly biased in the direction of travel of the belt. A second tracking assembly is positioned to constrain and align the belt immediately prior to the second drum in the lower span of the belt.

VFail-safe aircraft engine mounting system
p7761
sVabstract
p7762
VA fail-safe lug is carried by an engine frame member and receives a clevis carried by an engine mount member. The mount member includes side links that transmit transverse loads between the engines and the airframe and a thrust link that transmits axial, engine thrust loads between the engine and the airframe. A fail-safe pin is carried by the clevis and has an outer diameter that is smaller than an aperture in the lug and through which the pin passes, so that no loads are imposed on the fail-safe pin in normal operation. When one or more of the links are no longer capable of transmitting loads, the fail-safe arrangement becomes operative to accommodate the loads transmitted between the engine and the airframe.

VParachute slider reefing with friction induced retardation
p7791
sVabstract
p7792
VA novel parachute slider reefing process enhancement is presented that is distinguished by being significantly less dependent on aerodynamic forces than its predecessors and can, therefore, be designed to perform in a much more precise and predictable manner. This unique means of prolonging the effective reefing time of a parachute reefing slider means consists of adding a cord that extends downward from the lower region of the parachute canopy, to terminate near the lower end of the suspension network, along with a restriction means, to act in conjunction with the cord, to extend the reefed time interval beyond that which is typically provided by aerodynamic forces acting on the slider body.

VBag holder assembly
p7806
sVabstract
p7807
VA bag holder assembly is provided for suspending a storage bag and maintaining the orifice of the bag in the open position. The bag holder includes a base member, a plurality of bag support members, and a bag attachment means. The base member is preferably comprised of multiple beams joined together by a connecting means. The bag support members attach to and extend from the base member. Each bag support member comprises a bag attachment means for grasping and securing a portion of the bag to the bag support member. Once the opposing lips of the bag are secured against opposing bag support members, the orifice of the bag will remain open due to tension generated by the respective bag support members, thus allowing the use of two hands to place items in the bag or remove contents from the bag. Once loading or unloading has been accomplished, the user can rotate the bag support members approximately 270 degrees about the opposing ends of the base member until the opposing bag support members lie substantially flat against the underside of the base member. The invention further includes a method for loading and unloading a storage bag.

VMold for producing depressions in the sides of a molded block
p7926
sVabstract
p7927
VThe side walls of a mold have recesses in each of which is mounted a mold core for forming depressions on the outer side of a concrete block which is to be produced in this mold. The mold cores are pivotally supported around a horizontal axis which is parallel to the mold walls on the outer side of the mold. A sloping cam slot on each mold core is used to pivot the mold cores into the mold cavity defined by the mold walls and then back into the recess. The inner edges of a recess closely fit the mold core and function as strippers which self-clean all surfaces of the mold core which have come into contact with the concrete when the mold core is pivoted back into its recess. As a result, time intervals for cleaning the mold cores are greatly lengthened and a clean and smooth surface of the finished concrete block is insured.

VScavenging air/fuel-air mixture control device for a stratified scavenging two-cycle engine
p8046
sVabstract
p8047
VThe present invention facilitates proper control of the scavenging air and fuel-air mixture for a stratified scavenging two-cycle engine that is based on a crankcase compression/scavenging method, using any carburetor. The present invention includes a drive member, which rotates based on an accelerator operation, installed on the air valve of the air passage, wherein the drive member is movable through angular reciprocal movements. A slave member, which constantly contacts a cam provided on the drive member is installed on the throttle valve of the carburetor, and wherein the slave member is movable through linear reciprocal movements. A fuel flow-rate controlling mechanism works in cooperation with these linear reciprocal movements. The carburetor can be freely designed without regard to the orientation of the air passage and a looseness- and play-free interlocking mechanism having a cam and a spring can maintain the air valve and the throttle valve in a proper opening relationship, thereby stably operating the engine without upsetting the air/fuel ratio.

VA clearance seal assembly is disclosed. The assembly comprises a stationary member defining a first side, a second side and an opening connecting the first and second side; a moving member moveably disposed through the opening; and a sealing member circumferentially disposed between the stationary member and the moving member. The sealing member has a fluid-tight relationship with the stationary member. The sealing member and the moving member define a continuous and uniform gap having a size that allows the fluid to fill the gap but prevents the fluid from flowing through the gap from the first side to the second side of the opening under an operating pressure differential between the first and the second side. In a preferred embodiment, both the sealing member and the moving member are made of a ceramic material. The sealing assembly may also include a static seal disposed between the stationary member and the sealing to allow a variable clearance therebetween while maintaining the fluid-tight relationship between the sealing member and the stationary member. A pump utilizing the sealing assembly of the present invention is also disclosed.

VShaft seals for sealing pulverulent solids
p8226
sVabstract
p8227
VAn apparatus and method for providing a seal between first and second relatively rotatable parts of machines which operate in an environment comprising dust, grit or other finely divided solid material entrained in air, water or other fluid. The seal includes a rotor and a stator between which there is an annular passage with substantial clearance between the interfacing surfaces defining the passage. The solid material entrained in the fluid which enters the annular passage is deposited in layers on the interfacing surfaces when the mechanism is in use. The layers substantially reduced the cross sectional size of the annular passage and restrict flow of the fluid there through. The annular passage may be rendered tortuous by providing the rotor with annular fins which in use project into annular recesses in the stator, and vice versa.

VAn end of a seat belt is connected to an actuator that can selectively remove a slack from the seat belt. The actuator includes a main actuator unit, and a cushioning member for decelerating a movement of the moveable end of the seat belt following a certain initial travel of the moveable end. The main actuator unit includes a cylinder integrally attached to a part of the vehicle body, a piston member slidably received in the cylinder and connected to the moveable end, a pyrotechnic gas generator provided on one end of the cylinder, and an accumulator chamber defining a prescribed volume and communicating with an output end of the pyrotechnic gas generator. The main actuator unit produces an early rise in the vehicle occupant deceleration, and the cushioning member smoothly connects the time history of the vehicle occupant deceleration to a ride-down condition whereby the deceleration acting on the vehicle occupant is favorably spread over time, and the maximum level of the deceleration can be minimized. The accumulator chamber contributes to a favorable shaping of the time history of the vehicle occupant deceleration.

VHydraulic device
p8556
sVabstract
p8557
VA hydraulic device having a nut part with a threaded hole which has an internal screw thread with a defined nominal diameter and with a defined, uniform pitch, and having a screw part which has an external screw thread with the same nominal diameter as the threaded hole and with a defined, uniform pitch, which is screwed into the threaded hole. (In hydraulic devices, screw parts, in particular nozzle bodies, are generally adhesively bonded in place, in order to prevent them from becoming detached. Adhesive bonding has certain drawbacks, since the screw threads have to be free of grease, and in the case of nozzles there is a risk of blockages, adhesive can enter the hydraulic circuit and also process reliability is not ensured during application.) There is provided a slight difference between the pitch of the internal screw thread of the nut part and the pitch of the external screw thread of the screw part. This slight difference in pitch while the screw part is being screwed in leads to an elastic deformation of a plurality of thread turns, with the result that the screw part is secured so that it cannot become detached.

VThe present invention relates to a method of printing using dots of ink discharged from nozzles to form the image. It is desirable to prevent printing to occur if there is insufficient ink in the printer cartridge to complete the page. Before each page is printed the recorded amount of ink remaining in the printer cartridge is compared with the amount of ink need in the worst-case page to determine if there is sufficient ink to print the page. If there is the page is printed. After the page is printed, the number of dots of ink used to form the image is multiplied by the dot size and the resulting volume of ink used, is subtracted from previously recorded volume of ink to obtain the new volume of ink remaining in the cartridge.

VPrinting method for continuous ink jet printer
p9201
sVabstract
p9202
VAn continuous ink jet printer projects a stream of evenly spaced ink drops toward a substrate and controls placement of the ink drops on the substrate by selectively charging the individual ink drops and passing the charged ink drops through an electric field to control placement of said charged ink drops on a substrate. The printer may be used to print either single or multiple lines of print in a single stroke. A stroke consists of a single column from all lines and can have adjacent drops printed in alternating lines to reduce drop interaction. Each line of print in the stroke having N virtual print positions, at least some of which are being divided into pairs of adjacent positions. Each pair of adjacent positions has a first print position and a second print position. The printer includes a controller having a plurality of first and second look-up tables, each of which is associated with a different one of said pairs of adjacent print positions. Each of the look-up tables contains a plurality of charge values which correspond to the charge to be applied to a print drop in one of the first or second print positions, respectively, as a function of the charges of each of a predetermined number of drops that are proximate to the print drop in the drop stream. The adjacent drops may include a predetermined number of history drops that precede the print drop in the stream and a predetermined number of future drops that follow the print drop in the stream. The controller determines the charge to be applied to drops and produces a control signal responsive thereto by (1) retrieving a charge value from one of the first look-up tables if the drop is to be printed in one of the first print positions, or (2) retrieving a charge value from one of the second look-up tables if the drop is to be printed in one of the second print drop positions. A charging tunnel receives the control signal from the controller and charges the drops to the determined charges in response thereto.

VApparatus, products, and methods are described that relate to blending various disparate optical surfaces in a smooth and continuous manner. In cross section, the two disparate surfaces are represented as meridional profiles. A blend zone profile is described by a single third-order polynomial. In the case of rotationally symmetric optics, one cross-section suffices for the description of the entire surface. In the case of non-rotationally symmetric optics, an increased number of cross-sections are necessary to produce the desired three-dimensional surface, thus meridional profiles are calculated at selected azimuthal locations to describe the full surface.

VDisclosed herein are three-dimensional projection systems and related methods employing two electronically controlled projectors and a retro-reflective screen. The retro-reflective screen produces a known non-linear light reflection pattern when images are projected thereon. Image computational means are used to calculating flat image information for each projector based upon inputted stereopair images and information regarding the projectors and screen. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the projection system uses an image computational device that employs a neural network feedback calculation to calculate the appropriate flat image information and appropriate images to be projected on the screen by the projectors at any given time. More than two projectors can be employed to produce multiple aspect views, to support multiple viewers, and the like. In another embodiment, the projection system includes a digital camera that provides feedback data to the image computational device.

p9366
sVabstract
p9367
VA projection system including a light source, a rectilinearly reciprocating cylindrical lens array, an optical separator, a light valve, and a projection lens unit. The light source emits a beam. The rectilinearly reciprocating cylindrical lens array advances color beams along different paths upon reciprocation. The optical separator separates the beam emitted from the light source into color beams according to wavelength. The light valve receives the scrolled color beams transmitted by the cylindrical lens array and forms a color image by pixels turning on or off according to an input image signal. The projection lens unit magnifies the color image formed on the light valve and projects the magnified color image on a screen.

VThe present invention is based on the finding that the previous column and row representation in the scanning image projection has to be given up, in order to enable that the ratio between row and column frequency or vertical and horizontal deflection frequency is not critical and may be decreased. An inventive projection apparatus for projecting an image on an image field includes a deflection means for deflecting a light beam about a first deflection axis at a first deflection frequency and about a second deflection axis at a second deflection frequency different from the first, in order to move the light beam across the image field, as well as a modulation means for modulating an intensity of the light beam depending on the image to be projected. The first and second deflection frequencies differ by less than an order of magnitude.

VForm-error-cancelling mirror-support devices and related methods, and microlithography systems comprising same
p9441
sVabstract
p9442
VMethods and apparatus are disclosed for peripherally supporting X-ray-reflective mirrors such as used in X-ray microlithography systems and other X-ray optical systems. The methods provide effective physical support while reducing certain deformations in the reflective surface of the mirror. An embodiment of the method or mirror-support apparatus utilizes multiple ?pushing? and ?pushing? devices that apply a compressive stress and tensile stress, respectively, to respective locations on the peripheral-side surface of the mirror. One or more pushing devices and one or more pulling devices can be used as required. For example, at time of mirror fabrication, respective pushing devices can be placed adjacent concave-deviation regions and respective pulling devices can be placed adjacent convex-deviation regions on the reflective surface of the mirror. (Each pushing device produces an offsetting convexity in the adjacent mirror material, and each pulling device produces a corresponding concavity in the adjacent mirror material.) Thus, form errors arising at fabrication time are offset while simultaneously supporting the mirror.

p9456
sVabstract
p9457
VThis invention deals with the broad general concept for focussing light. A mini-optics tracking and focusing system is presented for solar power conversion that ranges from an individual's portable system to solar conversion of electrical power that can be used in large scale power plants for environmentally clean energy. It can be rolled up, transported, and attached to existing man-made, or natural structures. It allows the solar energy conversion system to be low in capital cost and inexpensive to install as it can be attached to existing structures since it does not require the construction of a superstructure of its own. This novel system is uniquely distinct and different from other solar tracking and focusing processes allowing it to be more economical and practical. Furthermore, in its capacity as a power producer, it can be utilized with far greater safety, simplicity, economy, and efficiency in the conversion of solar energy.

VThe present invention is directed towards apparatuses for rotating a gimbaled platform with rotatable actuators. Gimbal springs comprised of component springs with compliant axes that intersect at a nonzero angle are coupled to the gimbaled platform. Preferably, the compliant axes of the component springs are oriented at an approximately 45 degree angle relative to the actuator rotation axes. Wraparound lever arms coupling the rotatable actuators with the gimbal springs serve to increase the leverage ratio, thereby permitting greater platform rotation for a given actuator rotation.

VEven when a stay is mounted to a mounting surface with tilting angle different according to types of vehicles, a predetermined or more tilting range of the mirror assembly can be obtained, thereby securing a rear field of view. As a result, since an inside mirror can be for general-purpose use of types of vehicles having a mounting surface with different tilting angles, the inside mirror does not have to be designed and manufactured according to each type of vehicles, thereby lowering the cost of the inside mirror.

VAn apparatus for manufacturing a surface light source apparatus in which a light guide pattern portion is formed on a light guide panel includes a pattern design system to which data about a pattern to be formed on the light guide pattern is input. A control system is connected to the pattern design system and transmits a position signal matching a coordinate value of each pattern to be formed on the light guide panel. A header moving portion mechanically moves vertically and horizontally according to the position signal received from the control system. A laser system outputs a laser beam according to a pulse signal synchronized with a movement of the header moving portion. A lens portion allows a laser beam output from the laser system to pass the header moving portion and to be focused on a scanning surface of the light guide panel. A warp prevention unit prevents the light guide panel from warping due to a local heating by the laser beam. An absorption and scattering prevention unit prevents smoke generated when the light guide pattern portion is formed on the light guide panel.

The top case has a set of ?receiving photodiodes PDs of the channel number M. The bottom case has another set of ?receiving photodiodes PDs. ?signal beams and ?signal beams propagating in optical fibers go into the lightwaveguides on the middle case. The ?signal beams are reflected midway on the lightwaveguides by the WDMupward to the photodiodes PDs on the top case and are converted into photocurrents by the photodiodes PDs. The ?signal beams are reflected halfway on the lightwaveguides by the WDMdownward to the photodiodes PDs and are converted into photocurrents by the photodiodes PDs. The ?yielded by the laser diodes make their way in the lightwaveguides, go into a multichannel fiber and propagate in the multichannel fiber. The three-storied structure allows two sets of M-channel receiving signals and a set of M-channel transmitting signals to be received or transmitted. The three-storied structure enables the module to alleviate a necessary area and reduce optical, electrical interchannel crosstalk.

VThe invention concerns a soil compaction roller () and a soil compaction machine of which the roller () forms part. The roller () comprises a multi-sided, out-of-round, peripheral compacting surface () which can roll over a soil surface which is to be compacted. The compacting surface () is defined by a series of angularly spaced salient points () and a corresponding series of compacting faces (). Each compacting face () is outwardly convex in shape and extends continuously between two adjacent salient points (). When the roller () is operative with the compacting surface () rolling over the soil surface, the roller rises up on each salient point () in turn, storing potential energy, and thereafter rolls downwardly onto the succeeding compacting face () to transmit the stored potential energy to the soil surface to compact it. The instantaneous center of rotation of the compacting surface (), where it contacts the soil surface during rolling, moves continuously about substantially the full extent of the compacting surface.

VA method of decontaminating soil and ground water containing organic contaminants and divalent metal compounds. It comprises the steps of first treating such soils and ground water with an effective amount an aqueous solution containing a peroxide and a water soluble chelating agent for a time sufficient to have the water soluble chelating agent chelate at least one of the divalent metals of the divalent metal compounds present in the soil and ground water. Next, the chelated metals are brought into contact with the peroxide to catalytically convert the peroxide to an oxidizing agent. Finally, the last step is contacting the organic contaminants in the soil and ground water with the oxidizing agent to oxidize the organic contaminants to environmentally safe, non-toxic compounds.

VAdaptive load-clamping system
p10281
sVabstract
p10282
VA fluid power load-clamping system includes at least one fluid valve for variably regulating the maximum fluid pressure causing closure of the clamp. Preferably the valve increases the maximum fluid pressure automatically in relation to the measured magnitude of the weight of the load to regulate the load-gripping force. A controller causes the valve to permit a relatively high maximum fluid pressure as the clamp closes toward the load to enable high initial clamp closure speed. Thereafter the valve automatically reduces the maximum pressure as the clamping surfaces close into a predetermined relationship with the load, and then increases the maximum pressure to regulate the gripping force. Other preferable features include continuous weight-responsive automatic regulation of the gripping pressure while the load is supported by the clamp, and compensation of the weight measurement for the longitudinally-extensible position of the lifting mechanism, to maximize the accuracy of the load-weight measurement. Gripping pressure regulation is operable in response to linear load-lifting or tilting load-lifting, without concurrent clamp closure actuation. Different predetermined relationships between the weight of the load and the maximum gripping pressure are selectable alternatively. A gravity-referenced tilt controller adjusts the load automatically to an attitude which is untilted with respect to gravity. Lowering of the lifting mechanism is automatically prevented in response to the setting down of the load.

VA variable geometry vane for use in a turbine engine. The vane can be radially mounted in a shroud ring while outside the turbine engine. The shroud and vane assembly can then be mounted to an engine hub without disassembly of the shroud, eliminating the need for a split ring shroud. Once located surrounding the hub, vanes are slid radially inward until a radially inward vane button engages a hole within the hub. Vanes are locked in place using clips slid into slots within the shroud. The clips are retained in place using an adjacent engine part bolted to the face of the shroud. Once in place within the engine, vanes are attached to a control arm for airflow adjustment.

The air stream flows in a main stream direction in the discharge tube and in a discharge stream direction out of the discharge tube. The discharge stream direction forms an angle of greater than 0? with the main stream direction. The discharge stream direction has a transverse component that extends perpendicular to the main stream direction, which produces a force in the discharge tube perpendicular to the main stream direction. To reduce the transverse force produced in the discharge tube, a partial air stream is branched off out of the discharge tube and flows in a partial stream direction that has a compensation component that is directed opposite to the transverse component.

VHigh speed, high density interconnect system for differential and single-ended transmission applications
p10551
sVabstract
p10552
VThe present invention is directed to a high density electrical connector which can provide 80 or more twinax connections per linear inch in a 20 millimeter card slot. In a typical electronic system package, 20 millimeters is the spacing from center line to center line of the adjacent parallel daughtercards. Twinax cable is coaxial cable that contains two inner conducting wires rather than one. The two inner conducting wires provide two physical channels. Coaxial cable is called ?coaxial? because it includes one physical channel that carries the signal surrounded (after a layer of insulation) by another concentric physical channel, both running along the same axis. The outer channel serves as ground.

VElectrical connector with voltage detection point insulation shield
p10941
sVabstract
p10942
VAn electrical cable connector having a voltage detection test point generally includes an internal conductor, an inner insulating sheath surrounding the conductor, a conductive outer shield surrounding the insulating sheath, a separately molded plastic insulative shield disposed adjacent an opening formed in the conductive outer shield and held by the inner insulating sheath and a conductive voltage detection test point terminal disposed within the plastic insulative shield, wherein the test point terminal is capacitively coupled to the internal conductor for external testing of a voltage of the connector. In a preferred method for forming an electrical cable connector, such as a loadbreak power cable elbow connector, having a voltage detection test point, an insulative shield is first molded from a thermoplastic and a conductive voltage detection test point terminal is inserted within the plastic insulative shield. An outer shield is then molded from a conductive material. The conductive outer shield has an opening formed therethrough for accommodating the pre-assembled insulative plastic shield and test point terminal. After the pre-assembled insulative plastic shield and test point terminal are positioned adjacent the opening of the conductive outer shield, and after the conductive outer shield and an internal conductor are positioned within a mold cavity, an inner insulative housing is molded within the conductive outer shield and around the internal conductor. Upon molding, the pre-assembled insulative plastic shield and the test point terminal is held to the inner insulative housing. As a result, the test point terminal becomes capacitively coupled to the internal conductor for external testing of a voltage of the connector.

VPseudo-coaxial wafer assembly for connector
p10971
sVabstract
p10972
VA high-density connector utilizes a plurality of terminal assemblies that are assembled together into a block, or single unit, to form a connector. Each terminal assembly of the connector utilizes a plurality of conductive terminals having contact portions for mating with an opposing connector, tail portions for mounting to a circuit substrate and body portions held within an insulative body portion of the assembly. The body portions are supported within a housing in the form of a wafer which is plated with a conductive material so as to provide an all encompassing ground structure that surrounds the terminals and their insulative supporting terminal assemblies. In this manner a reference ground is provided around each signal terminal between its contact and tail portions that emulates a coaxial cable. The tails of the terminals and the ground structure have wide body portions with narrow contact portions to promote wicking of solder onto the tails for establishing a reliable solder mounting of the connector to a circuit board.

VFor miniaturizing and rationalizing the manufacturing process of contact devices for herring aids, it is proposed that an injection molded body be provided with metal contact springs according to the insert mold technology. Over and above this, wiring elements are applied on the injection molded body as interconnects. To this end, the injection molded plastic body provided with metal springs can be activated in specific patterns with, for example, a laser, and, subsequently, the activated portions are coated with conductive metal. Alternatively, the interconnects can also be printed onto the injection molded body.

p11031
sVabstract
p11032
VThe present invention provides an apparatus for propelling a small boat through a body of water by use of a sculling action. The apparatus may be comprised of a vertical stock attached to a vertical surface of the boat, normally the transom. A wide, flexible fin may project outwardly and rearwardly from the bottom end of the vertical stock. A tiller may extend from the top end of the vertical stock towards the bow of the boat. The pumping action on the tiller causes the fin to move back and forth in a sculling action so as to propel the boat through the water. The apparatus may be easily folded into a compact package for storage in the boat either for emergency use or for storage of the boat. The fin may be bifurcated into a plurality of panels for more compact and efficient storage. Plates provided to hold the fin in a vertical orientation may have flanges along their upper edges to provide a step for easy reentry of a swimmer into the boat.

VMethods for creating large scale focused blade deflections
p11061
sVabstract
p11062
VMethods are disclosed to design resilient hydrofoils () which are capable of having substantially similar large scale blade deflections under significantly varying loads. The methods permit the hydrofoil () to experience significantly large-scale deflections to a significantly reduced angle of attack under a relatively light load while avoiding excessive degrees of deflection under increased loading conditions. A predetermined compression range on the lee portion of said hydrofoil () permits the hydrofoil () to deflect to a predetermined reduced angle of attack with significantly low bending resistance. This predetermined compression range is significantly used up during the deflection to the predetermined angle of attack in an amount effective to create a sufficiently large leeward shift in the neutral bending surface with the load bearing portions of the hydrofoil () to permit the hydrofoil () to experience a significantly large increase in bending resistance as increased loads deflect the hydrofoil () beyond the predetermined reduced angle of attack. The shift in the neutral bending surface causes a significant increase in the elongation range required along an attacking portion of the hydrofoil () after the predetermined angle of attack is exceed. Methods are also disclosed for designing the hydrofoil () so that it has a natural resonant frequency that is sufficiently close the frequency of the reciprocating strokes used to attain propulsion in an amount sufficient to create harmonic wave addition that creates an amplified oscillation in the free end of the reciprocating hydrofoil (). Methods are also disclosed for focusing energy storage and blade deflections along focused regions of load bearing members and the hydrofoil (). Methods are also disclosed for reducing induced drag vortex formation along the lee surface of the hydrofoil (), reducing drag and increasing the formation of lift forces.

VThis invention relates to emergency flotation devices, particularly to a wearable device in the form of a collar; and most particularly to a device suitable for wear by a pet or young child which may be worn during watersports, and which will not deploy until predetermined nominal safety parameters have been exceeded. The present invention provides a personal flotation device, suitable for children, pets or the like, which will activate automatically in response to changes in pressure, e.g. water depth, time of submersion, or a combination thereof. As the device senses the change in pressure or time of prolonged submersion, the internal triggering mechanism punctures a hole permitting the compressed gas reservoir contained therein to be released, thereby inflating the device's inner flotation member.

Even when a vibration load acts on the electrode assembly during the insertion of the electrode assembly into the quartz glass tube, the metal foil is not easily deformed, so that a rod electrode can be prevented from largely swinging together with the metal foil. Consequently, the position of a tip end portion of the rod electrode can be easily recognized by using a camera, whereby the degree of the insertion of the electrode assembly into the quartz glass tube can be correctly adjusted.

VRod and connector toy construction set
p11166
sVabstract
p11167
VA rod and connector toy construction set, especially for use by young children. Connector elements, are formed with one or more rod-gripping sockets arranged radially with respect to a hub. The sockets are open at opposite sides, enabling lateral insertion and removal of rods. The connector elements, which are relatively large for easy handling by small children, are formed of a soft and pliant plastic material, to facilitate assembly and disassembly of rods with the connector elements by small hands. The rods generally are formed of a plastic material harder and stiffer than the connector material to accommodate easy handling of the rods during assembly and disassembly and to provide adequate strength in an assembled structure. The rods include enlarged, generally cylindrical end portions and adjacent neck portions of reduced diameter. The connector sockets include inner portions, configured to receive and closely confine the rod end portions, and outer portions arranged to receive and snuggly grip the rod neck portions, such that rods are held in axial alignment with the connector sockets.

VA process for finishing a disc drive slider in which a pressure generator applies multiple pressures to the back surface of one slider while the front surface of the one slider contacts a lapping surface to form a finished front surface of the slider. The slider is part of a substrate having multiple unfinished sliders formed in it. An etch process is used to etch trenches in the substrate aligned between the sliders and to form webs joining the sliders together. After the sliders are finished by lapping, the webs are removed to separate the sliders. The multiple sliders are conveniently held together during the finishing process and the etching process avoids damage to the sliders.

VMethods for aligning a surface of an active retainer ring with a wafer surface for chemical mechanical polishing
p11271
sVabstract
p11272
VCMP methods reduce a cause of differences between an edge profile of a chemical mechanical polished edge of a wafer and a center profile of a chemical mechanical polished central portion of the wafer within the edge. The wafer is mounted on a carrier surface of a wafer carrier so that a wafer axis of rotation is gimballed for universal movement relative to a spindle axis of rotation of a wafer spindle. An operation using a retainer ring limits wafer movement on the carrier surface perpendicular to the wafer axis. Another operation limits a direction of permitted movement between the wafer carrier and the retainer ring to only movement parallel to the wafer axis, so that a wafer plane and a retainer ing may be co-planar.

VA sieve assembly for separating grain from chaff inside of a combine. The sieve assembly comprises a plurality of longitudinal sieve planks that pivot on their longitudinal axis. A hanging weighted member combined with the sieve planks regulates the angle of the sieve planks relative to the combine. As the combine becomes laterally inclined on a hillside, the weighted member changes its angular position relative to the combine. In doing so, the weighted member causes the sieve planks to pivot on their longitudinal axis so that the sieve planks remain level relative to the horizon. Dividers extend between each sieve plank.

The contents of the compartments are visible from the outside. Each compartment contains a prize, such as a diamond. The housing may be part of, or linked to, a gaming device. When a player wins a game, which entitles the player to select a tangible award, the device signals this fact to the player. The player then selects a compartment by pressing an input device located on the housing. An attendant opens an external door, and inserts an electronic key into a receptacle associated with the selected compartment, and enters a required code into the key. The compartment then opens, and the player obtains the prize. The device may also include an inventory control system which preferably uses an RFID apparatus for monitoring the contents of each compartment, and for keeping records of an inventory of prizes.

VGolf club swinging guide
p11571
sVabstract
p11572
VA golf club swinging guide releasably attachable to a lower end of a golf club shaft. The guide includes a stationary member having an alignment surface which, when adjustably aligned parallel to the striking face of the golf club head, automatically orients the visual intended line of flight perpendicular to the club face. A movable member is connected for free rotation to the stationary member about an upright axis of rotation which passes centrally through an enlarged clearance aperture through the stationary and movable members to facilitate installation over the grip area of the shaft. A wind vane extends laterally from one end of the movable member whereby the movable member is responsive to movement of air to visually align itself in a direction that the golf club is swung. Visual misalignment between the intended line of flight and the actual direction of golf club swing is viewable during a golf swing. Temporary securement of the alignment at the instant of golf ball impact is also provided.

VSplicing joint and method for synchronous drive belt
p11751
sVabstract
p11752
VA splice joint is for joining first and second synchronous drive belt ends, of the belt type comprising a reinforcement material layer covering a base layer formed from a first thermoplastic material. The joint comprises a fused portion of the base layer of the first and second belt ends that define a splice region. At least one coating layer of thermoplastic material overlaps the reinforcement layer of the end portions in the splice region. The coating layer is comprised of a second elastomeric material intended to melt and penetrate into interstices of the reinforcement material layer while within the mold press. Migration of the base layer material through the reinforcement material layer to the pulley-engaging outer surface is thereby inhibited. The second elastomeric material composing the coating layer may be selected to provide desired frictional and wear characteristics.

VAn axle system includes an axle lubrication level within an axle housing which is lower than a wheel end lubrication level within the wheel end assemblies. An opening through the wheel end assembly housing provides a fluid communication path between the wheel end assembly and the axle housing. A differential assembly rotates adjacent an opening such that lubrication at the wheel end lubrication level is rotated into the opening. The lubricant within the wheel end assemblies is maintained at the wheel end lubrication level. The shaft enters the wheel end assembly housing through a shaft opening which provides a communication path for the lubricant from the wheel end assembly back into the axle housing.

VIn a vehicle in which a moderate throttle opening degree control of maintaining a degree of throttle opening that is less than a degree of throttle opening that corresponds to an accelerator operation is performed for a predetermined period following a beginning of the accelerator operation, if it is determined that a clutch-to-clutch downshift judgment has been made, the reduction of the engaging pressure of a disengage-side friction engagement device is restrained until it is determined that the moderate throttle opening degree control has ended. Therefore, even if the turbine torque is returned to a normal value at the end of the moderate throttle opening degree control, insufficient engaging torque is avoided, and the takeover of engaging torque for the clutch-to-clutch downshift is smoothly performed while the turbine torque is stable. Hence, occurrence of a shock related to the end of the moderate throttle opening degree control is suitably prevented.

VAn adjusting device for a tread board of a treadmill has an actuating device, a transmission device and a connecting member. The actuating device is pivotally connected to a bottom of the tread board. The transmission device is connected to the actuating device. The connecting member is connected to the transmission device with a first end and has a second end pivotally attached to the tread board. The connecting member has a middle point pivotally attached to a stand. Accordingly, the actuating device and the transmission device can actuate the connecting member to rotate relative to the stand, and the angle of the tread board relative to the ground is adjusted. Because the transmission device can pivotally rotate relative to the tread board, a large force will not be applied to the transmission device. Consequently, the load bearing of the transmission device is reduced.

The device includes a platform which is elevated at one end from a supporting surface for the device. A seat is located at the one end of the platform and a bowed back support member is disposed on the platform adjacent to the seat. The support member presents a convex curved surface of a longitudinal extent such that the back and head of the user can rest thereon with the user in a backwardly reclining posture. A resilient belt fits around the waist of the user while a restraining arrangement preferably in the form of flexible restraining members is adapted to engage the arms of the user during movement of the user from the backwardly reclining posture wherein the back of the user rests against the convex curved surface to a sitting position. The restraining arrangement thus increases the force that must be exerted by the abdominal muscles of the user in carrying out this movement.

VApparatus and methods for therapeutically treating damaged tissues, bone fractures, osteopenia, or osteoporosis
p12201
sVabstract
p12202
VApparatus and methods for therapeutically treating bone fractures, osteopenia, osteoporosis, or other tissue conditions. A platform supports a body to be treated. An oscillator is positioned within the platform and is configured to impart an oscillating force on the body. A capacitor assembly is positioned adjacent the platform for automatically determining the mass of the body being supported on the platform. Once the mass of the body is determined, an amplitude of the frequency of the oscillating force is adjusted to provide a desired therapeutic treatment to the patient. Also, the capacitor assembly is configured to turn the oscillator on and off as a function of whether or not a body is being supported on the platform.

sVabstract

VThe present invention relates to polymeric medical articles comprising combinations of triclosan and silver-containing compounds. It is based, at least in part, on the discovery that these agents act synergistically, thereby permitting the use of relatively low levels of both agents. While it had been previously found that triclosan can be particularly useful when used in conjunction with chlorhexidine, it has been further discovered that medical articles having suitable antimicrobial properties may be prepared, according to the present invention, which contain triclosan without chlorhexidine. Such medical articles offer the advantage of preventing or inhibiting infection while avoiding undesirable adverse reactions to chlorhexidine by individuals that may have sensitivity to chlorhexidine.

VAn electrosurgical system has an electrosurgical generator and a bipolar electrosurgical instrument, the generator being arranged to perform a treatment cycle in which radio frequency energy is delivered to the instrument as an amplitude-modulated radio frequency power signal in the form of a succession of pulses characterized by successive pulses of progressively increasing pulse width and progressively decreasing pulse amplitude. There are periods of at least 100 milliseconds between successive pulses, and the treatment cycle begins with a predetermined pulse mark-to-space ratio. Energy delivery between pulses is substantially zero. Each burst is of sufficiently high power to form vapor bubbles within tissue being treated and the time between successive pulses is sufficiently long to permit condensation of the vapor.

VLocking cap assembly for spinal fixation instrumentation
p12411
sVabstract
p12412
VA locking cap assembly for locking a spinal fixation element to a spinal fixation element receiving body includes an outer and inner locking element. The outer locking element has a proximal mating element, and a engagement element formed on the inner surface adjacent the distal end for engaging a spinal fixation element receiving body so as to close the spinal fixation element to the spinal fixation element receiving body upon tightening. The inner locking element has a deformable spinal fixation element contacting ring disposed on its distal end and a proximal mating element on its proximal end rotatably mated to the outer locking element proximal mating element so that the inner locking element is rotatably mounted within the outer locking element. Tightening the spinal fixation locking cap assembly to the spinal fixation element receiving body causes the deformable spinal fixation element contacting ring to contact the spinal fixation element and to deform the deformable spinal fixation element contacting ring to provide secure four point locking of the spinal fixation element within the spinal fixation element receiving body.

p12441
sVabstract
p12442
VA program of instructions for the processor which include: receiving an insertion length of a medical instrument inserted in a patient; and determining a distal end location of the instrument at a target site in the patient from the insertion length. The instrument typically has a straight proximal portion and curved distal portion, lies in a single plane and is a rigid guide member. The instrument is typically inserted and then fixed at a pivot axis outside the patient. The pivot axis is generally aligned with an insertion point at which the instrument is inserted into the patient. The program of instructions may include determining a subsequent location of the distal end associated with pivoting about the pivot axis. The program of instructions may include determining a subsequent location of the distal end associated with axial rotation of the instrument, determining a subsequent location of the distal end associated with linear translation along a length axis of the instrument and/or determining a subsequent movement of the distal end in a single plane about the pivot axis. The pivotal axis is typically a reference point used by the program of instructions in determining subsequent movement of the distal end.

VAnastomotic connector for sutureless anastomosis systems
p12471
sVabstract
p12472
VAnastomosis systems include fittings and compression mechanisms for effecting end?end or end-side couplings of biological or synthetic bypass grafts to vessel locations. The fittings are tubular and surround end regions of the graft. In some applications an end region of the graft is everted and surrounds an exterior of the fitting, in which case the preferred compression mechanism is a retaining ring. A tool is used to evert the graft end region. In other applications, the fitting has an interior groove that receives an expandable retaining ring that urges the graft end region radially outwardly against the fitting. A graft deploying and securing system includes a needle for puncturing vessel tissue, a dilator, and a sheath adapted for containing a graft/fitting combination and guiding the combination into the vessel through an opening formed by the needle and dilator.

VSystem and method of use for revascularizing stenotic bypass grafts and other occluded blood vessels
p12501
sVabstract
p12502
VA system and method for opening a lumen in an occluded blood vessel, e.g., a coronary bypass graft, of a living being. The system comprises an atherectomy catheter having a working head, e.g., a rotary impacting impeller, and a debris extraction sub-system. The atherectomy catheter is located within a guide catheter. The working head is arranged to operate on, e.g., impact, the occlusive material in the occluded vessel to open a lumen therein, whereupon some debris may be produced. The debris extraction sub-system introduces an infusate liquid at a first flow rate adjacent the working head and withdraws that liquid and some blood at a second and higher flow rate, through the guide catheter to create a differential flow adjacent the working head, whereupon the debris is withdrawn in the infusate liquid and blood for collection outside the being's body. The introduction of the infusate liquid may also be used to establish an unbalanced flow adjacent the working head to enable the atherectomy catheter to be steered hydrodynamically. A guide wire having an inflatable balloon on its distal end may be used with the atherectomy catheter to block the flow of debris distally, while enabling distal tissues to be perfused with an oxygenating liquid. At least one flow control port may be provided in the guide catheter to prevent collapse of the vessel being revascularized. A cradle is provided to fix the guide catheter and guide wire in position within the body of the being while enabling the atherectomy catheter to be advanced along the guide wire and through the guide catheter.

A functional element (e.g., a vascular filter) has a radially expandable body and includes a proximal slider and a distal slider. The proximal and distal sliders are slidable along the mandrel independently of one another such that the distance between the proximal slider and distal slider can be varied to effect different configurations of the functional element. In one method of using such a device, the functional element is urged distally to a treatment site by urging the mandrel distally. This causes the stop to exert a distal biasing force on the distal slider, which acts against a restorative force of the functional element to axially elongate the functional element and reduce friction between the functional element and a wall of the vessel.

VSuture anchor system and associated method
p12531
sVabstract
p12532
VA suture anchor system configured so as to facilitate implantation of a suture anchor within a bore formed in a bone, so as to secure a suture to the bone, is provided. Such a system comprises a suture anchor having a suture operably engaged therewith and an insertion tool having a tip and defining a first axis. The insertion tool is discrete with respect to the suture anchor and is capable of implanting the suture anchor within the bore such that the suture anchor is secured in the bone. The tip is engagable with the suture anchor and is configured to cooperate therewith so as to prevent the suture anchor from rotating about the first axis. Further, the insertion tool is configured with respect to the suture anchor such that a rotational force exerted on the insertion tool rotates the suture anchor about a second axis disposed perpendicularly with respect to the first axis. A predetermined axial seating force is then applied to the insertion tool, outwardly of the bore, to seat the suture anchor in the bore. The insertion tool is further configured so as to require an axial separation force to be applied thereto so as to separate the insertion tool from the suture anchor, wherein the separation force is no less than the seating force. Associated systems and methods are also provided.

VThe present invention provides modular bifurcated intraluminal tubular prostheses, particularly stents and stent-grafts, for the treatment of disease conditions, particularly aneurysms. Modular sections of the prostheses, or ?prosthetic modules,? may be selectively assembled to form a prosthesis having characteristics which are tailored to the specific requirements of the patient, including branch angle and branch lumen sizes which match the patients vascular geometry. A Y-connector prosthetic module structure provides support and separation for each of the adjacent branching lumens. Radiopaque markers on the prostheses promote alignment between prosthetic modules and with the body lumen system.

VSpinal vertebral implant and methods of insertion
p12576
sVabstract
p12577
VA spinal vertebral implant includes a substantially rectangular shaped base section made from a solid piece of bone. A nose section extends integrally from the substantially rectangularly shaped base section and preferably has a generally tapering shape to foster entry between adjacent vertebrae. The nose section tapers distally and inwardly from the base section to form a generally pointed or rounded distal tip portion and comprises a solid piece of bone. Serrated sides assist the implant in gripping adjacent upper and lower vertebrae and in being maintained therebetween. The serrated sides are angled in a manner that encourages the implant to be placed between the vertebrae and locked therebetween upon such placement. First and second implants may be placed into respective left and right sides of an intervertebral space. A method for placing one or more implants between the adjacent vertebrae comprises forming a slot configured to receive an implant and inserting the implant into the slot. Each slot is preferably formed from an upper slot portion and a lower slot portion in the posterior portion of adjacent upper and lower vertebrae, respectively. Instruments for performing the method include osteotomes, impactors, and spacers.

VA vacuum/purge operation of a loadlock chamber prevents an eddy phenomenon from occurring in the chamber and thereby prevents wafers from being polluted and damaged by particles in the chamber. A vacuum pump for providing the loadlock chamber with vacuum pressure, and a gas supply for providing the chamber with purge gas are connected to the loadlock chamber by an exhaust line and a gas supply line, respectively. At least one control valve is installed in each of the lines. At the time the state of pressure in the loadlock chamber is to be changed, the loadlock chamber is provided with both the vacuum pressure and the purge gas at rates that are inter-dependent to establish a flow of gases towards and into the exhaust line. Then, the supplying of one of the vacuum pressure and the purge gas is gradually reduced and cut off.

VElectric double layer capacitor and method for preparing the same
p12651
sVabstract
p12652
VAn electric double layer capacitor is disclosed which is capable of preventing transmission of an electrolytic solution vaporized in a basic cell through current collectors and capable of improving a yield. A method for preparing the electric double layer capacitor is also disclosed. The electric double layer capacitor comprises a basic cell prepared by the steps of: applying a current collector onto a surface of a substrate; disposing an electrically insulating gasket element on the surface the substrate in such a manner that the current collector laterally abuts on the gasket element to define a concavity; placing a polarizable electrode impregnated with an electrolytic solution on the surface of the current collector; oppositely disposing two intermediate products prepared through the foregoing steps on a separator in such a manner that the gasket elements abut on surfaces of a peripheral portion of the separator; fusion-bonding the gasket elements together to laterally cover the separator with the resulting unified gasket; and removing the substrates from the current collectors and the gasket. The substrate has a vapor transmission rate of a predetermined one or lower with respect to the electrolytic solution vaporized at a temperature of the fusion-bonding.

A center column is disposed in the axial center of the separator section and a plurality of serially connected curved plates are disposed between the outer shell and center column to define an elongated curvilinear flow path having reverse flow pathways. An oil-water-gas mixture is introduced into the separator section under pressure past heating coils and through the curvilinear path, the lighter density oil entering and being removed from the top of the center column, and heavier sludge and brine collecting in the containment section. Gases bubble up through the center column and are removed from the vapor dome.

VSelf-renewing air filter
p13011
sVabstract
p13012
VThe replacement of filters for Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. Organizations having responsibility for many apartment or dormitory units can spend a significant fraction of their man-hours replacing such filters. A novel approach to reducing the labor for this task is to attach one end of sheet-type filtering material to a dispensing roll, and the other end to a gathering roll; both rolls being affixed to a frame. The assembly is installed into an air duct and the filtering material allowed to blouse, somewhat. The flow of air is intermittent in typical HVAC systems, so when the air begins to flow, the filtering material is forced, due to its resistance to flow, in the direction of the flow. This energy?a force applied through a distance?is utilized by a lever arm bracket to advance the gathering roll. In this fashion, new material leaves the dispensing roll and is exposed to the air, while the dirty filter sheet accumulates on the gathering roll. The process is self-regulating because dirty filter material will present a greater resistance to flow and will, therefore, travel through a greater distance, advancing the gathering roll more.

VModified cellulose aggregate material
p13146
sVabstract
p13147
VA process and method is disclosed for producing a cellulose modified aggregate cement. The process and method advantageously applies a fortifying solution to a dry cellulose material so as to enable substantially complete absorption of the vital components of the solution into and upon the cellulose fibers. The fortifying solution also imparts to and forms a mixture with the fiber so as to provide sufficient water for hydration and cure of cement added thereto, without the need to extract excess water therefrom, thereby preventing the loss of said vital fortifying agents from the aggregate cement formed thereby. Upon admixing cement into the solution treated fibers, a plastic mixture of concrete is formed, well adapted for pouring into press molds for the fabrication of lightweight, high strength construction forms. In an alternative embodiment, a means of forming a raw aggregate material, while simultaneously reclaiming submerged land is disclosed. In the alternative process and method, cellulose waste material is added to submerged land to absorb, and form a wet pile of material there within. The waste material is then allowed to dry. Thereafter the material is treated with anti-mold agents, re-dried and purified/comminuted into cellulose fibers. Thereafter, the material is treated with fortifying agents in a pool. The material is once again allowed to dry and thereafter pressure treated with activating and water proofing materials to yield a raw cellulose modified aggregate.

VA coated nickel-base superalloy article, which is otherwise susceptible to the formation of a secondary reaction zone, is prepared by furnishing a nickel-base superalloy article substrate having thereon an initial aluminum-containing coating comprising an initial-coating additive zone and an initial-coating diffusion zone. The article is susceptible to the formation of the secondary reaction zone if heated to an elevated SRZ reaction temperature for an SRZ reaction period of time. The formation of the secondary reaction zone is avoided by first removing the initial-coating additive zone and the initial-coating diffusion zone, and thereafter depositing a subsequent aluminum-containing coating onto the article substrate. The subsequent aluminum-containing coating includes a subsequent-coating additive zone and a subsequent-coating diffusion zone. The article substrate with the subsequent aluminum-containing coating is otherwise susceptible to the formation of the secondary reaction zone if heated to the elevated SRZ reaction temperature for the SRZ reaction period of time.

p13416
sVabstract
p13417
VAluminum alloy compositions are disclosed, which include small amounts of calcium that result in improved surface properties of the cast aluminum. The calcium, and up to 0.25% grain refiners, are added along with alkaline earth metals, transition metals and/or rare earth metals to the aluminum alloy as a melt. The addition results in improved appearance, substantially reduced surface imperfections and reduced surface oxidation in cast ingot aluminum and aluminum alloys. The addition of small amounts of these additives, surprisingly were found to substantially eliminate vertical folds, pits and ingot cracking in more than one ingot casting technique. The additions also improved the appearance of the ingots, including reflectance. As a result, the ingots could be reduced or worked essentially right out of the casting without first conditioning the surface by, for example, scalping. Also disclosed is a method of improving the surface properties and preventing surface imperfections and cracking of cast aluminum alloys. The method includes the steps of adding calcium to a molten aluminum alloy that is essentially free of Be and casting the aluminum alloy using any commonly used technique.

VProcess for producing wear-resistant surface layers
p13446
sVabstract
p13447
VProcess for the effective production of very wear-resistant layers in the thickness range of 0.2 to approx. 3 mm by way of inductively supported surface layer modification. It can be used particularly advantageously for the protection of components of hardenable steels and cast iron with abrasive, corrosive, high-temperature corrosive or mineral sliding wear loading. With the process according to the invention a local two-stage inductive short-time preheating takes place directly before the surface layer coating. Due to the invention it is possible to coat even hardenable steels or other materials difficult to coat without cracking. Furthermore, even harder coating materials susceptible to cracking which provide better wear-resistances can be used. In addition, process speeds and surface coating performances can be achieved that are higher by a factor of 10 compared with conventional laser build-up welding. This abstract is neither intended to define the invention disclosed in this specification nor intended to limit, in any manner, the scope of the invention.

VMethod of austempering steel parts
p13461
sVabstract
p13462
VA method of austempering of steel parts is described. The steel parts are initially austenitized and subsequently quenched to a start temperature which is higher than the martensite start temperature. Then the steel parts are subjected to a first isothermal holding at the start temperature for a first time period. Subsequently the steel parts are held for a second isothermal time period at a finish temperature which is higher than the start temperature. The method described is particularly well suited for rapid austempering of steel parts, a pure bainitic structure being achievable, and the core hardness of the steel parts obtained being settable via the start temperature, the finish temperature, the duration of the first time period, and the duration of the second time period.

VPropellants and explosives with flouro-organic additives to improve energy release efficiency
p13476
sVabstract
p13477
VA non-/low-toxic, non-hypergolic, propellant formulation generally comprising metal nanoparticles, such as boron, aluminum, or carbon, and one or more fluoro-polymers mixed in in particulate form. The present invention takes advantage of the increased surface area provided by nano-sized metallic particles to enhance the metal's combustion efficiency, or ignitability. The inclusion of fluoro-polymers also aids in increasing the combustion efficiency of the metallic nanoparticles due to the presence of halogenic oxidizers. The thermal degradation of a halogenated fluoro-polymer additive in the propellant combustion zone serves to release halogens, thereby improving the combustion of the metallic nanoparticles and increasing the propulsion system's energy output. The present invention's formulation is safe to store and handle, environmentally-friendly, and may be economically manufactured to provide for widespread, cost-effective use.

VProcess for preparing a non-woven fibrous web
p13521
sVabstract
p13522
VDisclosed is a process for preparing a fibrous web. The fibrous web includes a microencapsulated material, such as a microencapsulated phase change material, adhered to the web. Preferably, the web is prepared in a melt-blowing or spun-bonding process. In the melt-blowing process, cooling water containing the microcapsules is used to cool melt blown fibers prior to collection on a collector. In the spun-bonding process, microcapsules are applied in liquid suspension or in dry form to a heated web, for instance, after the web has been calendared. The fibrous webs thus prepared have numerous uses, and are particularly suited to the manufacture of clothing.

p13611

VAn automatic thermal debonding process removes slider rows from a stainless steel processing fixture. The method uses a bimodal pitch adjustment and a mechanical row detainment mechanism to remove the rows from the fixture. The process allows full control of all critical process parameters such as accurate and repeatable row placement; controlled temperature and heat flow; controlled mechanical removal pressure; temporal control and variability; clean and contaminant-free working area; and full electrostatic discharge grounding and compatible materials. The bimodal pitch adjustment feature allows for continual, high-speed removal of the ceramic rows from the fixture after an automated heating cycle is complete. As the rows are removed, they are accurately placed into the detainment mechanism for the next process step.

p13626
sVabstract

VThe invention provides a separation method for object and glue membrane, and it is characterized: an external force such as tearing apart is pre-applied for appropriately separating the glue membrane and the object, such that the binding ability between the object and the glue membrane is reduced, and a taking-and-placing head then sucks up the object; to achieve said objective, it can arrange a vacuum sucking-up seat that is moveable and has vacuum adsorption hole under the glue membrane, and the sucking force of the vacuum sucking-up seat may generate an external force such as tearing apart to the glue membrane, and the object is then sucked up by the taking-and-placing head; it is also possible to arrange a connection rod to lower down and lift up the taking-and-placing head simultaneously and, before the taking-and-placing head is lowered down to contact the object, it may bring along the connection rod to press down the glue membrane and generate an external force such as tearing apart to the glue membrane, and the object is then sucked up by the taking-and-placing head; since the external force is not applied upon the object, so it may control the deforming rate of the objet to a minimum degree, such that the object may be avoided from being broken and be not caused to move, and it may also peel apart multiple chips, such that the production speed is increased and the taking-up time is shortened.

VImproved endpoint detection is obtained for wet etch and/or other chemical processes involving in situ measurement of bath impedance. The endpoint detection uses a measurement apparatus having a measurement circuit with a capacitor designed to alter the phase angle of the circuit. The capacitor is preferably a variable capacitor which is used to set the initial phase angle of the measurement circuit to about zero. The methods using the improved detection enable etch to be more precisely controlled even under conditions where noise would otherwise adversely impact determination of the endpoint.

A detector monitors a chemiluminescent radiation emitted from about a surface during cleaning of the process residues by the energized cleaning gas and generates a signal in relation to the monitored chemiluminescent radiation. A controller receives the signal and evaluates the signal to determine an endpoint of the cleaning process.

VThe method is for controlling the cooking temperature in a continuous vapour phase digester for chip-shaped cellulose material. A high pressure is established in the vapour phase largely by means of steam, without risk of attaining excessively high temperatures in the cooking. A temperature-controlled supply of cooking liquor in close proximity to the surface of the liquor level is introduced to obtain a protective liquor surface with a temperature lower than the vapour phase. A lower initial cooking temperature is obtained in the cooking zone, which ensures that the exothermic cooking process does not lead to the attainment of temperatures detrimental to the pulp quality.

Particles sputtered from the target are deposited on a deposition substrate spaced from both the ion source and the sputter target. An energetic beam of electrons can be generated by the incident ions striking the negatively biased sputter target and the deposition substrate is located either within or outside of this beam, depending on whether the net effect of bombardment by energetic electrons is beneficial or detrimental to that particular deposition process.

VPotential gradient detector for electrophoresis
p13941
sVabstract
p13942
VAn on-column detector for electrophoresis samples based on the principles of potential gradient detection, in which the electrodes for detection are physically isolated from the electrophoretic separation process, but maintains the same electrical potential as the corresponding interior of the electrophoretic separation channel. Potential gradient detection is used to measure the applied electrical field at two points within the electrophoretic channel during electrophoresis. When sample components with conductivity different from the electrophoretic medium passes between these two points, it causes a change in the potential gradient between the two points, which would be sensed by the sensing electrodes of the detector and registered by a data acquisition system. The apparatus can make use of conventional separation channel as well as separation channels on microchips. In accordance with the present invention, a sensor with electrically conductive medium is added and connected to the separation channel via a conductive element on the surface of the separation channel.

VMethods for fabricating metal nanowires
p13956
sVabstract
p13957
VMethods for the preparation of long, dimensionally uniform, metallic nanowires that are removable from the surface on which they are synthesized. The methods include the selective electrodeposition of metal nanowires at step edges present on a stepped surface, such as graphite, from an aqueous solution containing a metal or metal oxide. Where a metal oxide is first deposited, the metal oxide nanowires are reduced via a gas phase reduction at elevated temperatures to metal nanowires. Alternatively, beaded or hybrid nanowires comprising a metal A into which nanoparticles of a metal B have been inserted may be prepared by first electrodepositing nanoparticles of metal B selectively along step edges of a stepped surface, capping these nanoparticles with a molecular layer of an organic ligand, selectivley electrodepositing nanowire segments of metal A between nanoparticles of metal B and then heating the surface of the hybrid nanowire under reducing conditions to remove the ligand layer. In all three methods, the nanowires may be removed from the stepped surface by embedding the wires in a polymer film, and then peeling this film containing the embedded wires off of the stepped surface.

VAn apparatus and method for performing electrolysis on materials such as water, thereby electrically separating the electrolyte into its elemental components. More specifically, according to a preferred aspect of the instant invention, there is provided an apparatus for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen that uses a specially prepared cathode in conjunction with incident light energy to increase the efficiency of that process. A preferred embodiment of this apparatus uses the photo collector/cathode which comprises a thin layer of metal, preferably nickel, deposited by electroplating or a similar technique onto a conductive surface (e.g., a sheet of copper metal). During the electrolysis process, the cathode is irradiated with light, thereby reducing the amount of electrical energy necessary to separate a given quantity of electrolytic material.

A base defines an axial entrance to a fixed retainer that is complementary to the compatibility matrix of the cartridge roll seam. Axial slots accommodate the outwardly displaced portions of the roll seam while inward protrusions correspond to the location and inward displacement of the inwardly displaced segments of the roll seam. Incompatible filter cartridges are prevented from axial reception into the base. The number, configuration and location of inwardly and outwardly displaced portions of the roll seam may be varied to provide a variety of unique compatibility matrices.

The shut-off valve includes an elongated actuator lever which in a normal open position engages and retains a manifold latch plate in a latched position retaining the filter elements in connected relation with flow couplers to produce purified water. Upon movement of the actuator lever to a closed position shutting off the incoming water supply, the manifold latch plate can be unlatched from the filter elements to permit filter element removal and replacement.

In accordance with the method of the invention, supported peroxides are preferably formed by dispersing a mixture that includes at least one peroxide and at least one Cto Ccarboxylic acid into an aqueous solution that includes a compound that is capable of reacting with the Cto Ccarboxylic acid to form a water soluble soap. Dispersing the mixture into the aqueous solution results in the formation of an emulsion. A polyvalent metal compound that is capable of reacting with the water soluble soap to form a water insoluble metallic soap is then added to the emulsion, which converts the water soluble soap into a water insoluble metallic soap that precipitates from the solution. The organic peroxide is entrained within the precipitate.

VThe surface of a molded fiber reinforced polymer matrix article is prepared for subsequent metallization and painting by coating the molded article, preferably while it is still in its mold, with a layer of calcium carbonate-filled, but fiber-free polymer. The calcium carbonate-filled coating is then etched to dissolve particles of calcium carbonate from the surface layer to form fiber-free micro-pores in the surface layer. This porous provides an improved base for the deposition of a metal layer for receiving adherent paint layers and preventing ?out-gassing? of the composite body during baking of the paint layers.

VUltrasonic impact methods for treatment of welded structures
p14616
sVabstract
p14617
VThis invention provides methods of treatment for work products of materials such as steel, bronze, plastic, etc. and particularly welded steel bodies by pulse impact energy, preferably ultrasonic, to relax fatigue and aging and extend expectant life. The treatment may occur (a) at original production, (b) during the active life period for maintenance or (c) after failure in a repair stage. The ultrasonic treatment improves the work product strength. In welded products residual stress patterns near the weld sites are relaxed and micro-stress defects such as voids and unusual grain boundaries are reduced. The basic method steps are non-destructive in nature, inducing interior pulse compression waves with ultrasonic transducers and accessory tools impacting an external product surface with enough impulse energy to heat and temporarily plasticize the metal interior and relax stresses. The nature of the work product interior structure being treated is determined by sensing the mechanical movement at the impact surface of the work body to produce feedback frequency and phase signals responsive to input impact signals. These signals automatically conform driving pulse energy frequency and phase to the input transducers to match the mechanical resonance frequency of the working transducers and increase efficiency of energy transfer. Such feedback signals also are available for automated procedures which can improve product quality and consistency.

VThe adsorption rate of proteins from solutions on surfaces in the region of interface layers is often so large that a depletion of the protein in the interface layer results. Due to this, the total reaction becomes transport-dependent, sensitively disrupting the determination of the rate constants. In known TIRF-analysis chambers or bio-sensor systems with a liquid interface layer of ?10 ?m thickness and mass transport coefficients of 10-10m/s it has up limitation.\u000aWith the help of a TIRF-flow-through shear analyzer in which a certain volume unit of an immiscible fluid, for example an air bubble, is fed into the buffer flow, an ultra-thin liquid layer arises on the surface with a thickness of 100-200 nm, wherein interface surfaces below 10 nm thickness are technically possible.\u000aThe new TIRF-flow-through shear analyzer therefore allows the generation of ultra-thin liquid layers while increasing the mass transport coefficients for proteins by 50-100-fold so that the sorption rate constants can be determined without transport limitation.
